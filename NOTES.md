# Melee — the build notes

**The archive. `CLAUDE.md` is the live rules; this is why each one exists.** It is not loaded
automatically — `grep -n` it for a symbol, a build number (`(m146`), or the words in his
report, and read the entry before touching that system. New notes go at the TOP of the
landmine list, in the same shape: what he said, what was actually wrong, what was measured.

## Landmines

- **THE COAT LANDED ON A T-POSE, AND THE SKIN WENT BLUE (m260, `FL.tgtWait`, `flubAgain`, `FLUB.floor`).**
  *"It transforms into the guy in T-pose... and 95% of the balls are still just blue."* Two faults.
  **T-POSE:** the swap runs inside `stepMorph`, BEFORE `rigAnim` and the mixer -- so the skin just put on has
  never been posed and its bones are at BIND. Every landing spot was sampled off a T. And waiting a frame or
  two is not enough on its own: its clips come up from weight 0 over `skinWeights`' half-life, and a bone at
  partial weight is partly bind. So the targets are sampled two frames after the swap as a RECORD (triangle +
  barycentric, `flubSample`'s `rec`) and re-read off his live pose every `tgtEvery` frames until `tgtLive`
  past the apex (`flubAgain`) -- the same point on the skin, followed into his idle.
  **BLUE:** `floor` is a LINEAR luminance and .16 linear is mid-grey on screen, so dark clothes, blue spots
  and shaded skin all crossed it and glowed `hot`. .025 now (near-black only), and the apex `heat` tint .35 ->
  .12 so the skin's own colours carry the effect. (m259's sampler fix is the other half: before it, three
  quarters of every texel read was empty.)

- **THE GLOW TEXTURE WAS BROKEN BY A SEARCH-AND-REPLACE IN m250, AND IT IS EVERY GLOW IN THE GAME (m259, `DOT`).**
  *"It's literally the particles. The light on the missile is in the FRONT and off to the left... the blaster
  bullet doesn't look like a ball, it looks like a skewed few shapes. Did you mess with the sprite sheet?"*
  Close: m250 meant to raise `flubPix`'s canvas from 64 to 128 and replaced the FIRST
  `c.width = c.height = 64` in the file -- which is `DOT`'s, the one soft radial texture every `glowSprite`
  draws. The gradient under it is still centred at (32, 32) and filled over 64 x 64, so from m250 on the dot
  sat in the TOP-LEFT QUARTER of its own texture: every glow drawn offset toward a corner and clipped (the
  rocket's tail flame appearing ahead of and beside it; the blaster ball, a stack of three such sprites,
  three clipped quarter-blobs). And `flubPix` kept its 64 px canvas while drawing and reading 128, so three
  quarters of every skin read came back transparent black -- part of the black voxels m251 blamed on the atlas
  gutter. Both put right. **A `replace(..., 1)` on a line that is not unique edits whichever copy comes
  first** -- the patch script asserted uniqueness on every other edit in that build and not on that one;
  `git diff` of the build is what found it (the reticle square, m257, may be the same build's doing).

- **CORRECTION TO m258, WRITTEN THE SAME NIGHT: HOMING WAS NEVER THE CAUSE.** `WEAP.home.on` has been **0**
  since m36-era (*"the gun goes exactly where it is pointed"*), and `boltHome` returns on its first line --
  so the rocket was never being steered and m258's two guards are inert. **I diagnosed from the shape of
  the code without reading the switch above it**, which is this file's "check where it is called before
  what it does" rule broken one level up: check whether it RUNS at all. Also checked: `git log -L` on
  `fireRocket`, `aimRaw`, `aimPoint`, `muzzleWorld` and `chargeRelease` -- none touched since m189. So the
  crooked rocket / crooked blaster ball is in an INPUT those read (the weapon mount, the camera, the
  pose), not in the shot code. Open; asked for a recording of a shot leaving the gun.

- **THE ROCKET WAS BEING STEERED BY THE BOLT'S HOMING (m258, `ROCKET.home`, `boltHome`).** *"The rocket flies
  tilted and the fire is no longer at its butt... we never edited the rocket, it just got messed up."* He is
  right that the rocket never changed: `rocketBody`/`rocketFace` are m189 exactly, and `stepBolts` calls
  `boltHome` on EVERY bolt, rockets included -- curving it toward the straightest body in its cone at chest
  height, with a lead. That was mostly invisible while the street round the spawn was empty; m242..m252
  stood three pacifists there and Clancy was always beside you, so most rockets now bend mid-flight. A body
  turning under you reads from behind as flying sideways to its path with the flame off to one side, and
  `rocketFace` follows the bend, so the smoke curves away from the nose. Rockets fly straight now
  (`ROCKET.home` 0; tune -> ROCKET), and homing NEVER steers a shot into `K.pal` -- he dives out of your
  line of fire (`palDive`), and a bolt that bends into him undoes that. **What changed was the world round
  the code, not the code** -- worth suspecting first when "nobody touched it" is true.

- **THE RETICLE'S NEON IS DRAWN, NOT FILTERED (m257, `#retic circle.g`, `.fglow`).** *"Sometimes the aimer has
  a weird square texture over it instead of the concentric circles."* His screenshot: a square of speckled
  noise where the rings should be. The glow was two CSS `drop-shadow`s on the WHOLE element, over five
  rings scaled up to 1.95x and spinning on the compositor -- and WebKit rasterises a filtered layer like
  that as a texture of its own, which on a phone intermittently comes back as garbage the size of the
  layer. Each ring now carries a wider faint copy of its own stroke behind it (same dasharray, same
  colour, `stroke-opacity` .28): the same lit tube with no filter in the stack. **A CANDIDATE WITH A
  MECHANISM, NOT A PROVEN CAUSE** -- nothing here has a compositor; `.fglow` on `#retic` brings the old
  filter back for the A/B. If the square survives this, the next suspect is the reticle's ANCESTOR stack
  (anything else with a `filter` or `backdrop-filter` composited over it).

- **THE BURST COATS THE NEW BODY EVENLY, IN ITS OWN COLOURS, AND THE DOTS BREATHE (m256, `flubSwapEven`,
  `FLUB.sBirth/sPeak/sLand/sWob/colT`).** *"Sometimes the balls don't completely cover what you're
  transforming into, so it pops in... the colour of the poly they land on... grow a little so they cover
  more, start small, big at the peak, shrink -- ping-pong in size before they pop."* The cell match took a
  voxel's spot from the cell it CAME from, so a region the old body had little of got little coat. The burst
  now samples exactly ONE target per voxel by area over the new skin and pairs the two sets by RANK on the
  same (height band, angle) key -- a bijection, so the coat is as even as the sampling. Probed on a 2.2 m new
  body from a 1.7 m old one, landed voxels per fifth of its height: 406 313 322 326 433 (the ends carry the
  cylinder's caps). Colour goes to the landing spot's own texel within `colT` (.14 s) of the apex. Size:
  `sBirth` .6 -> `sPeak` 1.7 at the apex -> `sLand` 1.3 on the skin with a damped wobble (`sWob`), then the
  pop shrinks it away.

- **THE TRANSFORM IS ONE OUT-AND-IN NOW, AND IT IS PHYSICS (m255, `FLUB.shape` 4, `flubBurst`, `flubOpacity`,
  `mphSh`/`mphAt`).** *"Too many little steps. They all appear at once covering the surface, already moving
  outward along the normal at a random speed; they shoot out, reverse elastically at slightly random moments,
  spring back and approximate the new mesh. The old character fades out; at the apex the new mesh fades in,
  the balls stick with a little jiggle, then pop or fall away. And the dots should glow, not be shaded."*
      frame 0  every voxel on an even coat of the old skin, velocity = its POSED FACE NORMAL (`flubSample`
               now returns it, off the three skinned corners) x `vMin..vMax` + `vJit`; old body fades `fadeOut`
      flight   ballistic with drag until its own turn-back (`turn` x the out phase); soles bounce off the floor
      spring   underdamped (`hz` 3.4, `damp` .32) toward its anchor, then -- once the swap lands -- toward its
               cell-matched spot on the new skin: the swap is the TARGET CHANGING under a spring already
               pulling, which is why there is no seam
      apex     the swap, at `bOut` (.30) of `bDur` (1.7 s) -- `mphSh` gives the burst its own phase shares,
               so `stepMorph`'s swap moves with it; the new body fades in over `fadeIn`
      pop      `popAt` + random after the swap: a kick out and up, gravity, shrink over `popLife`
  **A FADE NEVER LEAVES A SKIN TRANSPARENT** -- `flubOpacity` turns `transparent` on only while it is
  see-through and remembers the material's own flag; the body taken off is put back to opaque AT the swap
  (it is detached then, and a skin left at 0 is invisible the next time it is worn), and `flubOff` restores
  both. **The dots are flat now**: no shading, a soft edge (`soft`), `dotGlow`, alpha-blended so neighbours
  melt into one form. Probed headless: out to .80 m, old body at opacity 0 by u .15, new at 1 by .45, landed,
  popped, everything gone by the end.

- **WHAT A VOXEL IS, IS A DIAL (m254, `FLUB.look`, `FLUBQ_VS/FS`, `flubSheet`).** *"Spheres over cubes, or
  circles aimed at the camera, or a sprite sheet -- even the water one."* 0 cube, 1 icosphere (80 tris),
  **2 DOT (default)**, 3 SHEET (`images/water_sprites_01.png`, 3 x 3, one random cell per voxel, tinted by
  the skin colour). 2 and 3 are one `ShaderMaterial` on an instanced quad: centre and size come out of the
  SAME instance matrix the cube gets, the corners are pushed out in VIEW space so they face the lens, and
  the in-plane angle is read off that matrix -- so a sprite turns as the voxel tumbles with nothing new to
  feed. The water sheet is drawn on BLACK with no alpha, so the cut-out is brightness (`cut`), the cracks'
  rule. `instanceMatrix`/`instanceColor` are declared by three's own prefix for a non-raw ShaderMaterial on
  an InstancedMesh with colours (checked in the vendored build). `quadK` makes a flat dot a little bigger
  than a cube so it covers the same. **The shader has never compiled outside a GPU** -- if look 2 or 3
  draws nothing, that is the first suspect, and 0/1 are plain `MeshBasicMaterial`.

- **AN EVEN COAT, AND THE POP (m253, `flubSample`, `flubArea`, `flubPop`, `FLUB.shape` 3).** *"They don't
  spawn over his whole body -- cover it much more evenly. They should pop out more or less at once, an
  impulse, shoot out into the stretched quasar with Flubber strands, stretch, then elastically shoot back
  to the centre, and the whole form elongates into the new character -- or squashes, taller or shorter."*
  **A RANDOM VERTEX IS NOT A RANDOM POINT ON THE SKIN.** A face and hands carry far more vertices per m^2
  than a jacket, so the voxels piled on the head and extremities. `flubSample` picks a TRIANGLE BY AREA
  (cumulative table per mesh, built once off the bind pose), a uniform barycentric point in it, skins its
  three corners and blends them, and reads the colour at the blended UV. Three bone transforms a sample,
  so it runs at a voxel's BIRTH and once at the SWAP only. The landing spots are now STATIC in `rig.root`'s
  frame, taken at the swap -- the body is hidden under the cloud, so half a second of pose drift is
  invisible, and the per-frame cost of the landing is gone. `FLUB NOTEX` in the chip if a skin's texture
  cannot be read (the voxels would then be the material colour).
  **THE POP** (default): every voxel born inside `popBorn` (.03 of `u`, ~4 frames) -> each springs,
  over-running, from its skin spot into the form (the quasar for most, the rubber's arms+balls -- new every
  time -- for the skin facing one) -> the jets and arms keep stretching (`stretch`) -> `popSnap` before the
  swap the whole form springs to a point at his middle -> from that point onto the new skin on a spring
  whose vertical and horizontal scale wobble OPPOSITE ways, harder the more the heights differ (stretch if
  taller, squash if shorter), the pivot sliding to his FEET so it reaches up rather than through the
  floor. Probed headless, old 1.7 m body -> new 2.2 m: 1800 born by u .03, burst to 1.8 m, collapsed to a
  0.01 m point at .61, reformed feet-planted with a 23% stretch over-run, settled, cleared. `dur` 2.2 s.

- **MOUSSA IS ON THE STREET (m252, `MOUSSA`).** Shredworld's `moussa_toon.glb` as `models/characters/moussa.glb`:
  Colin's rig family and Colin's 48 clip NAMES, re-drawn for his proportions, so he is a Colin row on his
  own clips (biker hit reactions borrowed, same as Colin). Measured off HIS file, not copied: walk 1.414,
  run 3.886 authored u/s; knock-down pairs agree (178/-175, -2/-1) so `flip: 0`; no face morph, no
  untextured primitive, so none of Colin's dressing. `beside: 1` -- he spawns by you with Colin and Jack;
  on the test site at (5, 8). Shares the hello. His Senegal flag patch is NOT ported (no wear mounts here).

- **NO BLACK VOXELS, AND THE DEFAULT FORM IS RUBBER FLUBBER (m251, `FLUB.shape` 2, `flubBoing`, `flubBack`,
  `FLUB.floor`/`hot`/`heat`/`jit`).** *"A lot of the cubes are black... the shape is too stationary... the
  cubes might be large... a central shape with arms with balls on the end that shoot out like rubber bands
  and snap back in, and that makes it transform into the new form."*
  **THE BLACK WAS THE ATLAS GUTTER.** The padding round every UV island is transparent black, and at 128 px
  a vertex on an island's edge samples it. A texel with alpha < 128 is now skipped for the nearest opaque
  one in a growing ring, and anything still darker than `floor` (a pupil, a black shoe) glows toward the
  blue-white `hot` instead of reading as a hole. The whole form also leans `heat` toward `hot` at its peak.
  **RUBBER:** the voxels gather into a jelly core (wobbling, `core` .17 of his height); `armsMin..armsMax`
  arms (4..9) are rolled NEW every transform -- direction, reach (.22..50 of his height), launch time,
  stiffness -- and each fires out on a damped spring that over-runs (`flubBoing`: 1.27 at the peak, settles
  ~0.3 s later), a thin strand with a ball on the end that whips while it moves. `snap` before the swap
  they spring back stiffer, the core BULGES as they land, and after the swap the mass wraps onto the new
  body on an easeOutBack (`overshoot` 1.6). Which skin streams down an arm is the skin FACING it, so a
  patch stays a patch. Every voxel also drifts round its place on its own clock (`jit`) -- the forms were
  sculptures before. 1800 voxels at .036 m (was 1400 at .05). Probed headless: core .51 m, arms out to
  ~1.2 m at full stretch, back to .34 at the swap, landed on the new body, cleared.

- **THE FLUBBER'S CLOUD IS A SHAPE AT HIS SIZE, AND THE SKIN STAYS IN ITS PATCHES (m250, `FLUB.shape`,
  `flubForm`, `flubKey`, the cell-matched `flubSwap`).** *"It's massive. I meant a quasar -- skinny at the
  top, skinny at the bottom, wide in the middle, like a spinning top. Or Flubber. And the colours: I thought
  it'd look like the skin turns into particles and morphs into the other skin."* Both halves were one fault:
  m249's field threw every voxel off its OWN anchor by an all-directions noise of amplitude 1.25 m plus a
  radial push -- a screen-filling cloud whose neighbours came from anywhere on the body, i.e. confetti.
  Now a voxel's place in the form is a function of WHERE ON THE BODY IT CAME FROM, `(height 0..1, angle)`:
      QUASAR   head -> top jet, feet -> bottom jet, the rest -> disc rings by height, inner rings faster;
               disc .32 x his height, jets .52 -- measured on a 1.7 m body: rim .47 m, never beyond
      FLUBBER  `arms` tendrils (7) in random directions per transform; angle picks the tendril, distance
               from the waist picks how far out, blobs at the core and the tips, a wobble growing to
               the tip -- reach .85 m on a 1.7 m body
  So a skin's patch stays one patch through the form (a band of shirt is a ring of the disc). And the
  landing is matched the same way: the new body is sampled into a 14 x 12 height x angle grid and each
  voxel takes a vertex from ITS OWN cell, so head lands on head and the colour morphs LOCALLY. Texture read
  went 64 -> 128 px, and **`mphTint` is a no-op in this style** -- the white-out was washing the skin out
  of the voxels before they left. Tune -> TRANSFORM: form, form size, quasar disc/jets, flubber arms/reach,
  spin, wobble, glow.

- **m248 CRASHED ON EVERY DNA SHOT, AND THE TRANSFORM IS A PARTICLE MORPH NOW (m249, `FLUB`, `flubMorph`,
  `flubSwap`, `SURGE.mode`).** His screenshot: `FRAME m248 ... mphBlow ... stepMorph ... frameBody`.
  `mphBlow` places the swap's embers on the blob's measured silhouette `MPH._r`, which only `mphFill`
  builds -- and the stream never calls it, so the swap threw `null is not an object` every time. It
  runs only when `MPH._r` exists now. **An effect switched off has to switch off its punctuation too.**
  *"They could take their colour from the alien's skin and morph in colour to whatever you're morphing
  into... detach from one body, shoot out into a crazy abstract shape, like Flubber, a nebula, and come
  back together as the new character."* `SURGE.mode`: 0 blob, 1 stream (m248), **2 flubber (default)**:
      PEEL    1400 voxels born at random POSED vertices of the old body, each coloured from that body's
              own texture at that vertex's UV (`flubPix`: one 64 x 64 copy per map, sRGB decoded, x the
              material colour; unreadable -> the material colour, never a throw)
      NEBULA  old body hidden; each voxel thrown off its anchor by three crossed low-frequency sines of
              the anchor, moving (`freq` lobes per metre, `churn` speed) -- lumps, not jitter -- plus a
              radial push and a lift, glowing as it goes
      REFORM  every voxel has a target VERTEX on the new body, read off its LIVE pose each frame (a hidden
              skin's skeleton is never updated by the renderer, so `flubPose` does it), colour sliding
              to the new skin's
      SETTLE  new body shown at `land`, voxels shrink into it
  Anchors live in `rig.root`'s frame, so the cloud walks with him. One `InstancedMesh`, opaque by
  default (`add` 1 is the glowing version). `FLUB.dur` 2.0 s. Probed headless on two fake skinned
  bodies through a whole transform: peel 0 -> 1400 voxels in the old colour, nebula out to 1.9 m, back
  to 0.25 m on the new body in the new colour, body hidden through the middle and shown at the end,
  pool cleared. **The texture read is a device question** -- the probe has no canvas. Tune ->
  TRANSFORM: style, flubber length, voxels, voxel size, nebula size / lumps / churn / glow, glow mode.

- **THE TRANSFORM IS ROBITS' SUPERCHARGE NOW (m248, `SURGE`, `surgeEmit`, `surgeMorph`, `surgeStep`).**
  *"In Robits there's a power-up you run through and particles stream out of you, organic and blobby,
  like being on fire but blue... they emit from the normals, it covers the form, then you transform the
  form they're coming out of and the particles dissipate."* Found in `robits/index.html`: the
  SUPERCHARGE pickup (`_superPickupTick`, the blue sun on `powerup_middle`) starts `_superStart`, which
  runs `_voxelize(player.model, {hide:false})` -- every frame, random vertices of the SKINNED mesh in
  their current pose, an additive cube printed at each, spinning, drifting and fading (`_voxTick`).
  **Ported as one `InstancedMesh` (2400 pool, one draw call), in metres** (Robits' robot is ~35 units,
  so its 2.3 cube is .085 m), with three changes: cubes leave **along the skinned NORMAL** (the bone
  transform run on `pos` and `pos + n*.02` gives the posed normal -- no second skinning path), they
  are **buoyant** like Robits' fire voxels rather than falling, and drift dies with `Math.exp(-k*dt)`.
  **As the DNA transform** (`SURGE.on`, default 1): the rate climbs over the old body, peaks at the swap,
  `SURGE.burst` comes off the NEW body at the swap, and the rate falls so the cloud dissipates off him.
  The body is never hidden in this style; the cubes cover it. It runs `SURGE.dur` (1.5 s) because a
  cloud has to be seen BUILDING -- the blob keeps `MORPH.dur` .90, and `stream (0 = blob)` in tune
  brings the m113 blob back for the A/B. **`aura on me`** streams it off you continuously, Robits'
  `_voxSelf`, so it can be looked at without the DNA gun. Tune -> TRANSFORM has density, size, speed,
  rise, life, hue, white-hot, length. **The VIRUS turn still uses the blob** -- it removes the old body
  at the start (`bodyGone` in `virusGo`), so the stream has nothing to come off; that is its own build.

- **COLIN IS ON THE STREET, AND HE IS THE DONOR (m247, `COLIN`, `K.beside`, `besidePlace`, `K.morphOn` /
  `fillMat` / `opaque`).** *"Can we bring in the Colin model the same way we did for Jack? I'd love to
  see myself walking around, be able to shoot him."* `models/characters/colin.glb` is Shredworld's file
  byte for byte, a civil wearing his OWN 51 clips raw (nothing retargeted), the biker's hit reactions
  borrowed because he has none. **The meshless `donors/colin_anims.glb` is gone**: the full Colin loads
  first in `CIVILS` and Jack borrows from him, so the donor costs nothing extra. `npm run donor` stays
  for a future donor who is not also a character.
  **SHREDWORLD'S TWO COLIN LANDMINES CAME WITH HIM AND ARE HANDLED IN `bodyProto` AS KIND FIELDS**: his
  head mesh is a generic base and `Colin_Head_MIX` at 1 makes it his (`morphOn`); his `teeth` primitive
  is untextured 0.5 grey and pokes a millimetre past his lips, so any map-less material takes the
  `head` MESH's material (`fillMat`, found by mesh name -- his materials are `Material.00N`); `opaque`
  takes the eyes off `BLEND`. `NO FILLMAT COLIN` in the chip if the head ever stops being findable.
  **`K.beside` GENERALISES m243**: every beside kind (Colin, Jack) is skipped by the crowd deal and placed
  next to the spawn by `besidePlace`, each 2.5 m clear of Clancy and of the ones already placed. On the
  test site Colin is at (2, 8), beside Jack at (-1, 8). He shares Jack's hello (`greet`, same object, so
  tune -> JACK drives both).

- **JACK SAYS HELLO (m246, `K.greet`, `greetStep`).** *"If you walk up to him, within like 10 or 15, he
  looks at you and then waves."* Inside `r` (10 m) he drops whatever he is doing, turns to you with the
  ordinary `faceTo` ease, and only once he is FACING you (`face` .35 rad) and `delay` has passed does he
  wave -- `n` (2) plays of Colin's one-shot `waving`, replayed on its own clock and rewound on the state.
  He keeps looking at you while you stay, waves again after `again` (14 s), and walking off past
  `r * out` resets him so the next approach gets a fresh hello; leaving mid-wave hands him back to the
  roam with a short wait so he does not stride off mid-gesture. Inside `foeWander` below the flee and
  the unstick, so being hit still sends him running. Tune -> JACK (`hello range`, `waves`,
  `wave again`); any pacifist kind can carry a `greet` block.

- **JACK STANDS UP STRAIGHT AND HIS ARMS CLEAR HIS BODY (m245, `K.arms`, `armFix`/`armUndo`).** *"His
  arms go straight down in the idle and clip his body -- we adjusted his upper arms out and compensated
  down with his lower arms. And the idle he's doing looks mopy, hunched."* Measured on Colin's clips,
  neck-over-hips lean: `idle_exhausted` **20 deg**, `idle_sad_kick` 15, `idle_neutral` **4** -- the two
  sad ones are out of his pools. And `idle_neutral` holds the upper arm only **10-15 deg** off straight
  down, which Colin's narrow frame clears and Jack's does not.
  **THE FIX IS A PER-KIND POST-MIXER EDIT IN WORLD TERMS**, so no rig's local axes are assumed: each
  upper arm turns `up` deg about `cross(shoulder->elbow, outward)` (away from the body), each forearm
  `fore` deg about `cross(elbow->hand, down)` (back toward down), conjugated into the parent frame so it
  stacks on the clip, weighted by how much of the pose is a clip in `on` (idle/walk/run -- a knock-down,
  get-up or dance stays as authored). **Taken off again before the next mixer update** -- Shredworld's
  c128 spine-unravel landmine. Probed through the vendored loader on the real donor skeleton: +14.0 deg
  out on both arms symmetrically, hands ~6 cm off the body, forearms back down, and undo/reapply leaves
  **0 drift**. Tune -> JACK (`arms out`, `forearms down`); any kind can carry an `arms` block.

- **KIT CITY IS WHERE EVERY COLD START LANDS (m244, `WORLD`).** *"When I reloaded the game at one point
  we didn't load the main world."* The world pick lived in `localStorage` with the TEST SITE as the
  default: one tap of the world key stuck for every later launch, and a store iOS had cleared dropped
  him on the test site. The default is `tkit` now, the key's pick is `sessionStorage` (survives the
  reload the key does, nothing longer), the old persistent key is removed on boot, and `?w=` still
  picks a world for one load. `npm run check:boot` now boots KIT CITY by default; `MEL_WORLD=test`
  is the test site.

- **JACK WAS DEALT LAST AND THE DEAL RAN OUT (m243, `spawnBeside`, `JACKK`).** *"I haven't been able to
  find him in the level anywhere."* m242 put him in `CIVILS` and let the crowd place him -- and
  `crowdDeal` is ROUND-ROBIN in roster order with him at the END, so any world whose sweep finds fewer
  clear spots than it wants (`KIT CROWD n/m` in the chip) runs out before his turn and he is never
  spawned. **A new character nobody can find is not in the game.** He is placed like Clancy now: the
  nearest clear spot to the spawn from 4 m out, at least 2.5 m from Clancy, in every world (`spawnBeside`,
  shared by both populates), and on the test site at (-1, 8), open ground in front of the spawn. He is
  excluded from the deal and from `crowdWant`, so nobody else loses a spot to him.

- **COLIN IS THE HUMANOID DONOR, AND JACK IS THE FIRST TO WEAR HIM (m242, `COLIN`, `JACK`,
  `npm run donor`, `buildDonor`, `K.legRef`).** *"Jack doesn't have any animations but he can borrow
  them from my Colin GLB... idles, walks, runs, in-air pose, dances, get up, knockdown, take damage --
  and other characters in the future."*
  **JACK'S RIG IS COLIN'S FAMILY EXACTLY**: `Armature[0.01] > root > Hips`, the same 65 Mixamo bones,
  bind pose **0.03 deg** off Colin's on every one -- so `bodyBorrow`'s single-delta retarget is exact
  and the whole feature is a table plus a load line. (His file arrived at `models/jack.glb`; it lives
  at `models/characters/jack.glb` now.)
  **THE DONOR IS COLIN WITH THE CHARACTER TAKEN OUT.** A donor is read for his bind pose and his clips
  and nothing else, so `npm run donor` writes `models/characters/donors/colin_anims.glb` from
  Shredworld's `colin.glb`: no meshes, morphs, textures or materials, no scale tracks, no non-Hips
  translation (all things `retarget` never reads), and no rifle/skate/bar clips (no NPC reaches them).
  **10.17 MB -> 3.46 MB, 32 clips.** GLTFLoader still makes every joint a `Bone` because the SKIN names
  them, mesh or no mesh -- checked by loading the file through the vendored loader (68 bones, 32 clips).
  **RERUN `npm run donor <colin.glb>` WHEN HIS COLIN IS RE-EXPORTED.**
  **A MESHLESS DONOR HAS NO HEIGHT TO MEASURE**, so `bodyProto` falls back to `K.authored` (1.3152,
  printed by the tool off the draco geometry before it is dropped) -- the one typed number, measured.
  **HIS REFERENCE SPEEDS ARE `npm run gait`'s**: planted foot 0.997 on `walk_fwd_neutral`, 2.935 on
  `run_fwd`, both feet agreeing, `idle_neutral` 0.000 as the control.
  **`K.legRef` MULTIPLIES A BORROWED REFERENCE BY THE RETARGET'S OWN `k`** (the Hips-height ratio, .913
  for Jack): a stride is a leg length, and m144's factor of exactly 1 is only true inside one build of
  body. Opt-in, so the fat six's tuned feet do not move.
  **THE KNOCK-DOWN PAIRS WERE MEASURED, AND THEY AGREE** (hips->head bearing in plan): `fall_to_back`
  ends 178 / `get_up_from_back` starts -176; `fall_to_face_down` -1 / `get_up_from_face` 0. So `flip: 0`
  -- the default turns a body by pi between the front pair, which here would be a 180 on the floor.
  `flying_*` END UPRIGHT IN MID-AIR (hips .46, head .90), so `flying_backwards` is his air pose and not
  a landing.
  **COLIN HAS NO HIT REACTIONS**, so `borrow: [COLIN, BIKER]` -- first donor with the name wins, and the
  biker supplies `hit_take_damage_00/01` and the big one. The day Colin carries hits, they take over
  with no edit.
  **HIS FLOURISHES ARE COLIN'S DANCES**, and `foeWander` now holds a stop until a flourish FINISHES
  (`roamT >= skinLen(look)`) -- for everybody, which also means the civils finish fanning themselves.
  **A NEW CHARACTER WITH NO CLIPS IS NOW:** drop him in `models/characters/`, a `civil(...)` row with
  `borrow: [COLIN, BIKER]` and Colin's clip names (JACK's table is the template), and a spot.

- **THE TRUCK IS SMALLER AND PARKS OUT OF THE OPENING SHOT (m240, `TRUCK.k`, `truckHide`, `KDEPOT`).**
  *"It's massive, and it's right in my view when the game starts."* `k` .72 of the worker's own scale
  (tune: TRUCK size, live -- `truckRescale` scales the model, both wheel radii and the collider by the
  same ratio). It parks at his yard's marker the moment an export carries one (any `marker` naming
  "truck" or "depot" that is not the fire station's, with `yaw_deg`), and until then on the clear
  spot 35-70 m from the spawn most BEHIND the starting lens. And the worker only takes it when it is
  on the way (`takeK`: nearer than .6 of the walk to the job) -- parked out of sight, it was a longer
  walk to the truck than to the wall.
- **STREETS, HOMES, JOBS -- WHAT THE EXPORT SHOULD CARRY NEXT (his plan, m240).** The truck drives the
  worker's A* path at its own width, which crosses lots and pavements. To drive the ROADS it needs
  the roads as a graph: either centre-line curves exported as point chains (`lane_<n>` with ordered
  `lane_<n>_<i>` empties, or one mesh edge-chain per lane), or empties at each junction plus the
  links. Each job character's home base wants one marker per building (`home_construction`,
  `home_police`, `home_fire`, `hangout_donut`) and per vehicle spot -- the same shape `nav_repair`
  and `fire_truck_park` already have.

- **THE TRUCK IS SOLID, THROUGH A DYNAMIC LIST EVERY QUERY SEES (m239, `BDYN`, `truckBox`).** The box
  grid is built once; a truck crosses it, and re-gridding 7,400 boxes a frame is not an option -- so
  `boxesNear` also tests `BDYN` directly. The player's resolver, `foeMove`, the bolts (`boxRay`,
  `boltBox`), `camHit` and `groundAt` all go through it, so one list makes the truck a wall, a bullet
  stop and a roof you can stand on. Its box is the body's bounds IN THE TRUCK'S FRAME at rest (bed
  down), refreshed every frame as a turned box (`cs = cos h`, `sn = -sin h`, `boxLocal`'s own
  convention). It is `_off` while the truck finds its own ground and while it plans its own path,
  or it stands on its own roof and plans around itself. No decal lands on it (a scorch would stay
  in the street when it drove off). The worker walks to a point `hop` out from the running board,
  clear of the box, then boards.
- **HIS WORKER EXPORT WITH CLIPS LANDED (ead3690): 18 clips, `idle_on_truck` among them** -- `rideRe`
  takes it by name, so the chip's `(noride)` goes.

- **HIS WORKER RE-EXPORT HAD NO ANIMATIONS, AND A CHARACTER WITH NO CLIPS IS A T-POSE (m238).**
  *"I only added one animation, yet he is now stuck in T-pose."* Read out of the file: eb91f5f is 70
  nodes / 68 joints / 1 mesh -- the rig byte-for-byte the shape of the old one -- and **0 animations**
  (was 17), 1.7 MB -> 385 KB. The export dropped every clip, including the new one. The previous file
  is restored (eb8b538's) so he works, and `bodyProto` now puts `<file> NO CLIPS` in the chip for ANY
  character that loads with none -- a file that loads fine and stands in its bind pose is otherwise
  indistinguishable from the game ignoring its clips.
- **THE DUMP TRUCK (m238, `TRUCK`, `truck`, `buildTruck`, `truckStep`).** `models/vehicles/dump_truck.glb`:
  rigid parts parented to joints (NOT skinned), so a joint's `rotation.x` turns its part. Nose +Z,
  axles on X, back wheel r .329 / front .275 in the file -- each spun at its own rate. Scaled by the
  WORKER's measured scale (same Blender scene), so `stand_point` lands at his feet with nothing typed.
  Bed and ram both `-Rx` (solved: bed pivot is rear-bottom, so front-up is negative; the ram's top
  moves back as the bed tips, so it leans back, also negative) -- `bedSign`/`liftSign` if wrong.
  The worker: a job further than `useAt` 22 m with the truck free -> he walks to its running board
  (`d.goal`), boards (`rst 'ride'`, glued to `stand_point`, facing its heading), the truck plans an A*
  path at `r` 1.3 to the job and drives it (turning on a speed-dependent radius, braking for the end),
  parks `stopAt` 5 m short, he hops off to its left and walks the rest, and the bed dumps. Knocked
  off mid-ride, he walks. Chip: `TRK<state>[+]` (+ = rider aboard), `(noride)` until his export has
  a clip matching `rideRe` (truck / ride / standing_on). NOT YET: no collider, no road-following.

- **"Script error. @ ?:?:?" IS A MUTED ERROR, AND THE FRAME NOW CATCHES WHAT THE WINDOW CANNOT READ
  (m235, `frame` -> `frameBody`, `FRAMEERR`).** He got it "going to game". Nothing on the page is
  another origin, but Safari also mutes errors from a module brought in with `import()` -- which is
  how `weirdkit_detile.js` arrives (m219), and its hook runs inside every city material's compile,
  i.e. inside `renderer.render`. A muted error carries no message, file or line to `window.onerror`,
  so `#crash` could only print the placeholder. An Error CAUGHT in our own code is never muted: the
  whole frame body runs in a try, the first occurrence of each message paints `FRAME <build>` and its
  STACK, and the loop keeps going instead of dying. Not reproduced here (check:boot passes and m234
  touched none of that path) -- this makes the next report name the line.

- **RES AUTO WAS PINNING 2.0 FOR A MINUTE AT A TIME (m234, `perfStep`).** m233 chip: `pr2.00h`, 20 fps, no
  fire and no water on screen -- where m232 read 44 fps at pr 1.55. The auto rule stepped BACK UP when
  a drop "did not help" (the next 2 s window was not `gain` better) and then held for `hold` 60 s. A
  heat spike or a turn of the camera inside that window reads as "did not help", so it climbed to the
  top and froze there. Now down is always allowed and the hold only blocks going UP. With the city
  geometry fixed (m232) the frame is fill-bound enough for the pixel ratio to matter again -- which
  it did not at m20x, when a million triangles were the wall.
- **THE KERB EASE WAS INVISIBLE BECAUSE THE CAMERA SNAPPED (m234).** m228 eased his drawn height, but
  `cam.tgt` read `p.pos.y` raw -- the lens is damped but its LOOK POINT is not, so the whole view
  pitched up the kerb on the frame he did and his easing body read as the same teleport. The look
  point rides `stepOff` now; the trigger also takes `vel.y < 1` as well as `grounded` (the frame of a
  snap is not always a grounded frame) and up to 1.5 steps, and the chip counts them (`ke<n>`) so
  "it does nothing" and "it never fires" are one glance apart.
- **WATER GETS THE FIRE'S OVERDRAW RULE (m234, `SPOUT.maxPx/near/nearK`).** Drops clamp to .2 of the
  screen height and thin toward .45 within 14 m. On the tune panel under WATER.

- **A FIRE IN YOUR FACE WAS THE REST OF THE 20 FPS (m233, `FIRE.maxPx/dens/near/nearK`).** m232's
  chips: the same ~400k triangles gave 45 fps a street away and 20 facing a burning building -- so it
  was no longer geometry, it was OVERDRAW: every window fire is big additive cards, and at arm's length
  each one covers a slab of the screen, all of them on top of each other (`rend` 4 -> 11 exactly in
  those shots). Three dials, all on the tune panel under FIRE: `gl_PointSize` is clamped to `maxPx`
  (.3) of the framebuffer height in both flame pools; `dens` scales every emission rate; and within
  `near` [4, 16] m of the lens the rate falls to `nearK` (.4). A card that would have covered half
  the screen now covers under a third, and there are fewer of them exactly when each is expensive.

- **20 FPS WAS THE GPU DRAWING THE WHOLE CITY EVERY FRAME, AND THE MERGE IS WHY (m232, `CELL`).** His
  m230 chips, one view: `cpu4 rend3 /24ms` (41 fps) and `cpu14 rend10 /50ms` (20 fps). The JS is a
  few ms and done; `rend` only swells when the draw call blocks on a GPU that is behind; and it swings
  41 -> 20 in the same spot, which is a GPU at its limit (and heat). The chip also said `987kT`, and
  the files say why: visual 554k triangles, kit buildings 342k, and **m157/m178 merged each material
  into ONE mesh spanning the whole city** -- a bounding sphere the size of the map is never outside
  the frustum, so the triangles behind the lens and past the fog were all drawn, always.
  So `kitBatch`, `buildTCity`'s instancing and its merge all key on a 48 m cell as well as the
  material (`cellOf`), every emitted mesh is registered (`cellReg`), and `cellStep` hides one whose
  sphere is wholly past `fog.far` + 10 -- the frustum cannot, because `camera.far` is 400 and the fog
  is opaque at 300. More draw calls, far fewer triangles; the chip reads `c<shown>/<cells>`.
  **The shaders were never it** -- anti-tile and wobble off moved nothing, which in hindsight was the
  first proof it was geometry and not pixels.
- **m232 also ships his 956877f bakes**: visual 6 detile + 11 carriers, buildings 9 detile.

- **HIS WORN BLEND (956877f, m231).** Six `WK_M_*_worn` partners on six more `dt_carrier_*` nodes in the
  visual (11 carriers now). Three walls take one as `extra`: `brick_peeking_through_plaster` in
  `reveal` mode, siding and brick in `mix`. `weirdkit_detile.js`'s `fragBody` lays the extra AFTER
  whichever base mode ran, so reveal + extra needed no change -- read, not assumed. Pieces file
  unchanged, so the twins are byte-identical.

- **THE FRAME IS TIMED BY PART, IN THE CHIP (m230, `PROF`, `pT`).** *"Neither of them really do
  anything -- 20-21 both on and off."* Anti-tile off, wobble off and (m20x) resolution down all left
  the frame rate where it was, which is what a CPU-bound frame looks like: the GPU's pixel and vertex
  work is not the wall. So `frame()` is cut into parts -- plyr (aim/kit/player), kit (moto/kitStep),
  traf, body (dummies/she/morph), rig (anim, mixer, doll), cam (camera, x-ray, lights, sun), fx
  (bolts .. fire), misc (dust, shafts, hud), rend (`renderer.render`, i.e. the CPU cost of issuing
  the draw calls) -- and the chip prints `cpu<total> <top four> /<frame ms>`. Total near the frame
  time = CPU-bound and the parts say where; total far under it = the wait is the GPU. **Read the
  numbers before touching anything else**: two builds of shader switches were spent on a guess.

- **THE TUNE PANEL FOLDS AND SCROLLS BY HAND (m229, `tuneOpen`).** *"I can't scroll the tune panel and
  it's too long."* It was `overflow: hidden` inside a page that is `touch-action: none` with every
  touch cancelled for the sticks -- native scrolling could never reach it. Headings are now fold
  toggles (remembered in `mel.tuneOpen`, all shut by default), and a drag anywhere that is not a
  slider track moves `scrollTop` directly. The heading toggles on POINTERUP with under 8 px of travel,
  not on `click`: a synthesised click is exactly what the double-tap guard cancels, and a drag to
  scroll must not open a section on the way past.

- **A KERB IS EASED IN THE PICTURE, NOT IN THE BODY (m228, `STEPUP`, `stepEase`).** *"When I go from the
  street up onto a curb he just teleports up the foot."* The collider snaps up to `MOVE.step` in one
  frame and must -- a body that climbed over several frames would be inside the kerb. So a grounded
  rise of `min` .03 .. one step in a single frame is taken off the DRAWN height (`player.stepOff`)
  and damped back to 0 over `hl` .055; the board rides the same offset. Down adds nothing (falling is
  the physics'), and anything bigger than a step (ladder top, respawn) is ignored. Tune: KERB.
- **20 FPS AFTER m219-m227 -- AND THE SWITCHES TO FIND OUT WHY, ON THE PHONE (m228, PERF -> anti-tile,
  `detileUse`, `kT` in the chip).** Measured offline, his m226 buildings export went 261k -> 342k
  triangles (+31%: `WK_M_paint_decals` 32k, `WK_M_paint_flat` 20k, more ivy) and 23 -> 27 materials,
  which is a few more draw calls after `kitBatch` -- real, not a cliff. The per-PIXEL suspect is the
  anti-tiling shader: value-noise fbm plus a second (and on `WK_M_brick`/`WR_Lot` a third) texture
  fetch on every fragment of road, lot and wall, which is the kind of cost that scales with the
  screen rather than with the scene. The per-VERTEX one is the wobble (three 3D noises per vertex on
  342k triangles). So: `anti-tile` 0/1 restores each material's exact pre-detile hook and cache key
  (one recompile each way), `wobble` 0 skips its maths, and the chip now reads `N DC NkT` (draw calls
  and thousands of triangles) beside the FPS, so each switch is one look.

- **THE KIT BUILDINGS WOBBLE, BY WORLD POSITION ONLY (m226, `KWOB`, `kitWobMat`, the KIT row).**
  His spec: offset each vertex by a smooth 3D noise of its WORLD position, ~0.03 m at ~3 m, never by
  normal or object, so a vertex two pieces share moves the same and no seam opens. So the offset is
  computed at the world point and carried back into the mesh's frame through `inverse(mat3(model *
  instance))` -- exact for the batch at identity, the instanced parts and a twin under its group.
  Chained like `kitCutMat` onto every material `buildKit` sees in the city (walls, trim, glass,
  `_dressing`, `_murals`, `_clutter`), and the twins wear those same materials by name, so a swapped
  wall wobbles identically. **It goes in RIGHT AFTER `#include <begin_vertex>` and keeps that line**,
  so the cutaway's world point, the detile's `vDtWorld` and `project_vertex` all see the moved
  surface, and a hook chained later still finds its anchor. Replacing `project_vertex` outright would
  have looked equivalent and silently disarmed the detile, which anchors on it. Colliders untouched.
  `wobble` on the tune panel, .03 by default, 0 skips the maths.
- **HIS m226 EXPORT (72f9fc8):** the stations are `kit_029` (fire) and `kit_005` (police), which
  `KCITY.kitRe` takes as they are; `solid_kit_NNN_clutter__dumpN_0 / __palletN_0` (72 of them) parse
  as pid `kit_NNN/palletN` and go through `kitObb` into `KWCOL` like any kit solid -- no wall swap ever
  names that pid, so they are never taken away. Twins 60 -> 96 (6 kinds x 16 styles).

- **WATER HAS TO READ AGAINST A BLUE SKY, SO IT GOES TOWARD WHITE (m225, `SPOUT.bright/white`, the
  WATER rows).** *"The blue water is hard to see, especially on the sky."* Blue on blue is the one
  contrast the spray lacks; foam is white and white is what neither the sky nor the street has. The
  drop colour is mixed `white` .4 toward white and multiplied by `bright` 1.4 (tone mapping is off
  on that pool, so the cores clip to pure white), opacity .7 -> .9, drop size x2.4 -> x3.0. All of
  it plus density and spread are on the tune panel under WATER. **`tuneGet/Set` took an array index
  after the dot and nothing else**, so `sheet.sizeK` read `o.sheet[NaN]` -- it takes a property name
  now too.

- **A BROKEN PROP TAKES ITS MARKS WITH IT (m224, `brkDecalOff`).** *"When I shoot the hydrant or the
  barrel it leaves this mark floating in the air."* `brkBlast` stamps a bullet hole on a breakable
  that survives a hit, and the bolt stamps its own mark on the face it struck -- and when the prop
  broke, nothing removed either, so the cards hung where its faces had been. m174 wrote `decalOff`
  for exactly this on wall chunks; breakables never called it. `brkBreak` now clears every mark
  inside the prop's box (padded .25, because `brkBlast` stamps at `rad` round the centre); a hydrant
  keeps its body, so only the marks above `HYD.capY` go.

- **THE GEYSER CARDS ARE OFF; THE SPRAY IS HIS DROP SHEET (m223, `SPOUT.geyser.on` 0).** *"The geyser
  looks insane. It's way too wide to be coming out of the spout... just use the drops, like the
  particle geyser, with my newest water sprite sheet."* The card's width is its height x the cell's
  .75 aspect, and his art fills the cell edge to edge, so the column was ~3.7 m across on a 44 cm
  hydrant. A sheet only drops in as a billboard if the art's footprint matches the thing it comes out
  of. The machinery stays behind `on` for a narrower re-draw; the spout is m160's particle jet again,
  at full `jetN`, each drop one of his nine splashes.

- **HIS DROP SHEET IS NINE SPLASHES, NOT A CLIP (m220, `SPOUT.sheet`).** `images/water_sprites_01.png`,
  1024 square RGB on black, 3 x 3 distinct splashes -- so `play` 0: each drop takes one cell at random
  and keeps it, at a random turn, `sizeK` 2.4 so the droplets drawn round each splash read. Keyed off
  black in the water pool's own shader (alpha `smoothstep` of brightness, colour un-premultiplied),
  detected off an opaque corner. With the geyser cards up the drops run at `geyser.drops` .35.

- **HIS GEYSER SHEET IS THE WHOLE COLUMN, NOT A DROP (m219, `SPOUT.geyser`, `geyserCards`,
  `geyserFrame`).** `images/geyser_sprites_01.png`, 1536 x 1024 RGB on black, 8 x 4 = 32 cells of
  192 x 256 with the base at the bottom: row one rises, rows two and three gush, row four dies down.
  m218's per-drop hook was the wrong shape for it (and stays off, `sheet.file` empty). Two cards per
  main, base on the spout, turned to the lens about VERTICAL only -- a column billboarded on all axes
  tips over when looked down on. Rise once, ping-pong the gush for the main's life, and **the fall
  waits for the loop to reach frame 23** so it never jumps from mid-gush. Keyed off black like fire 3
  (alpha from brightness, colour un-premultiplied, premultiplied blend), so it is water over a bright
  street and not light added to it. The drops stay at `drops` .35 for the splash at its foot.
  Sized off the spout's own height (`hK` 1.15, the hydrant's 4.5 m -> a ~5 m card).

- **HIS ANTI-TILING SHADER IS HIS OWN MODULE, IMPORTED AS IS (m219, `DETILE`, `cityDetile`,
  `models/toon_city_kit/weirdkit_detile.js`).** Pushed on `assets/city-detile` (2afa55e) with the
  three kit-city exports; fast-forwarded into main. What the files carry, read out of them:
  visual 6 `wk_detile` materials + 5 `dt_carrier_*` nodes (the B textures), buildings 9, pieces 9
  -- so **15 patched** is the right number (visual + buildings; the pieces only feed the twins,
  which wear the BUILDINGS' materials by name, so theirs are never drawn).
  **Loaded with `import('./' + A(...))`**: the `./` is load-bearing (a bare `models/...` is a bare
  specifier and the import map refuses it), and `A()` needs `js` in `bump.mjs`'s `EXT`, which it
  now has. It runs once, after `buildKit`, over the whole `scene`: it CHAINS onto whatever hook a
  material already has, so it is last -- after `tcTint` and `kitCutMat` -- and the tint still
  reads the mixed colour because `map_fragment` precedes `color_fragment`. The merge and the kit
  batch both keep material OBJECTS, and a carrier is one mesh with a unique material, so neither
  pass can merge or drop one. **The chip says `DT<n>`**; `DT0` is lost extras, `NO DETILE JS` is
  the module. **Re-run after his exports:** `npm run ktx` on the visual and the buildings, and
  `npm run twins` (the twins went 42 -> 60 on this export: 6 kinds x 10 styles).

- **A FIRE ON A PROP BURNS FROM THE GROUND, AND THE WATER WAS DARK BECAUSE OF ITS BLEND (m218,
  `fireFloor`, `FIRE.propA`, `watPool`, `SPOUT.sheet`).** *"When I shoot the fire hydrant the fire
  starts at the very top of it... it needs to burn around the ground"* and *"the water looks
  horrendous, just black soot balls."*
  **Fire:** `fireIgnite` found its floor with `groundAt`, which counts every box top as ground --
  right for walking (you stand on a bench), wrong for a fire: a hit on the hydrant put the fire on
  the hydrant's own box top. `fireFloor` is `groundAt` without breakables and without any box whose
  footprint is under `propA` 2.5 m^2, searched only DOWN from the hit (`triGround` step 0). A roof, a
  car roof or a floor slab still holds a fire.
  **Water:** `puffPool` outputs PREMULTIPLIED colour and the pool was on plain `NormalBlending`, which
  multiplies by alpha again -- a 30%-opaque pale-blue drop drew at 9% brightness. The smoke shares
  that pool and is meant to be dark, which is how it hid. Water has its own premultiplied material.
  **And it takes his sheet when he makes one**: `images/water_sprites_01.png`, 4x4, transparent or on
  black (detected off the corner at load), played once per drop. Until it exists, the soft dots.

- **HIS CRACK SHEET IS A SECOND DECAL STORE, KEYED AT LOAD (m217, `DECAL.crack`, `crackLoad`,
  `crackKey`, `decalStore`).** *"Four crack sprites for damage on the ground, probably walls too --
  2 x 2 on a grey background, hope that works."* `images/crack_sprite_01.png`, 1024 square. The
  grey is FLAT -- (123, 122, 122) in all four corners with zero spread, measured -- so it keys out by
  colour distance from the corners (`key` [3, 40]), and each partly-keyed pixel is un-premultiplied
  off that grey so crack edges are crack-coloured, not haloed. Checked by compositing the keyed
  result onto a light ground offline before wiring anything.
  **THE DECAL SYSTEM WAS ONE POOL ON ONE TEXTURE, SO A SECOND SHEET NEEDED STORES.** `decalStore`
  is the old build body per texture; every mark carries `d.st`, `decalPut` writes into that, and
  `decalStep`/`decalOff` walk `decal.stores`. The cracks are store two (40 marks, one more draw
  call, `renderOrder` 3 so they sit over the atlas's scorches).
  **Kinds:** all four are `crack`; the pits (left column) are also `crackpit`, the lines (right)
  `crackline`. **The ground slam has asked for `crack` since m186 and now gets it** with no code
  change. The rocket stamps a crack (`ROCKET.crack` .9) over its scorch on the ground, on a wall,
  and under a body it hit (m216's branch). The blaster is unchanged.

- **A ROCKET ON A MAN LEFT NO MARK, BECAUSE A BODY IS NOT A SURFACE (m216, `ROCKET.markH`).**
  *"When I hit a character and the fire goes on the ground, there's supposed to be a mark on the
  ground too -- a crack -- and there's not."* `boltHit` stamps its decal only under `if (b.hitN)`,
  and `hitN` is the face a surface test reported -- a bolt caught by `dummyHit` never has one. The
  little fire got to the ground anyway because `fireIgnite` snaps itself down with `groundAt`; the
  mark had no such step. Now a rocket with no `hitN` looks straight down and stamps a flat `blast`
  scorch (with its rubble) if the ground is within `markH` 2.6 m. **And the same branch carried
  `brkBlast`/`kitBlast`**, so a direct hit on a man used to leave the crate beside him untouched --
  it reaches them now. The plasma bolt is unchanged: a hit on a body is still no mark.

- **HIS HYDRANT REPLACES THE OLD ONE BY STANDING ON ITS CLAIM (m215, `HYD`, `buildHydrant`,
  `hydBreak`).** *"I added a props folder with the fire hydrant and the fire hydrant collider...
  let me know how that fares, cause if I need to break it up more I can."*
  **What the file is, read straight out of it:** one node tagged `breakable: hydrant, hp 50,
  on_break: water_geyser`, one mesh, three WK materials (panels 236 tris, post metal 318, trim 48)
  with COLOR_0, no draco, and **no broken pieces and no `fx_*` spout marker**. The collision file is
  one 12-triangle box, x +/-.22, y 0..0.88, z -.22..0.30 -- identical to the `cols` in the visual's
  extras.
  **THE OLD TWENTY ARE STILL WHAT SAYS WHERE.** `debris_hydrant_*` in both city visuals are already
  claimed by `brkClaim` with his hp and yaw, so `buildHydrant` hides each old instance, drops its
  box, and stands the new model on `groundAt` at that spot (the old node's origin was 22 cm up
  inside a mesh whose own base sat 8 cm above that -- typed placement would float it).
  **Loaded after BOTH the visual (the claims) and the collider (the ground)** -- in the kit city the
  collider comes after the visual, which is why it is not a `buildTCity` hook.
  **THE CAP IS CUT IN CODE AT A MEASURED SEAM, `capY` .53.** Panels have no triangle between y .48
  and .56, the post metal none between .50 and .80, the trim stops at .525 -- so the dome and the
  nut split off cleanly by triangle centroid. Five InstancedMeshes (body x3, cap x2) for all twenty.
  Breaking one zeroes its cap slot, throws a real copy into `WRECKS` at `BRK.capUp`, cuts the box
  down to the body, and starts `spoutGo` at the seam.
  **If he wants control:** export the cap as its own node (and an `fx_` spout marker) and this can
  read those instead of cutting. `mel.HYD.capY` is the dial.
  **`models/props` went into `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- the twelfth time.

- **HIS GROUND SHEET, RE-CUT ON BLACK (m214).** The haze is gone at the source: flames on pure black,
  added onto the scene, and black adds nothing. `groundSheet.key` came down from [.16, .42] to
  [.015, .10], so it now drops only near-black and leaves the dim flame edges and embers. The
  smoke frames still barely show, because additive grey is a glow rather than smoke.

- **GROUND FIRES BURN ON THE GROUND, ON HIS THIRD SHEET (m213, `FIRE.groundSheet`, `gflame`).**
  *"I shot a barrel and the fire starts from where the rocket hit and floats -- it needs to burn
  on the ground."* A ground fire (any fire that is not a room's) now draws `fire_sprites_03.png`:
  4 x 4 frames, 1024 square, RGBA, flames on a bed of embers with the base at the bottom of each
  cell. Its cards are PLANTED: the base on the ground (a point sprite is centred, so it is lifted
  by half its size), no rise and no drift, one play through the sixteen frames. It is its own
  pool and its own draw call, and it keeps the embers and the glow. Bodies, windows and rooms
  keep the air sheet (`pick`).
  **The sheet carries a brown haze round every flame.** Decoded: 33% of its pixels are alpha 200+
  at a mean brightness of only 114/255. Added onto the scene that is a glowing brown cloud, so
  the shader keys it: `key` [.16, .42] of linear brightness ramps from nothing to full.
  The chip's fire token gains a `G` once the ground sheet has loaded.

- **THE WATER TUBE IS GONE; THE SPRAY IS BACK, DENSE AND VISIBLE (m212, `SPOUT.column`).**
  *"It looks like a tube of light, it doesn't read as water -- what it was was better, it just
  needs more particles."* m211's streaked cylinder read as a light beam, and a shader cannot make a
  solid tube read as water. m160's jet is back: the same cone off the spout's axis, solved to
  reach `height_m`, arcing over and landing. But it is now 170 big ALPHA drops a second (.13 ->
  .30 m, life 1.8-2.4 s so they actually land) instead of 90 additive 13 cm sparks, with
  `watStep`'s splashes and the 4.6 m puddle. `column: 1` brings m211 back for comparison.
  **The hydrant that looks like a floating flag is the ASSET.** `debris_hydrant` /
  `brk_hydrant_intact_mesh` is a 577-triangle Tripo mesh, 0.42 x 0.61 x 0.22 m, identical in
  both city visuals and the breakables file. The game draws it as authored, so a reduction pass
  that flattened it has to be undone in the file. A replacement keeps the node names, the
  `breakable: "hydrant"` tag and the `fx_hydrant_water_spout` marker, and needs nothing here.

- **THE HYDRANT GUSHES, AND IT KEEPS ITS BODY (m211, `SPOUT`, `watAt`, `jetMat`,
  `BRK.capOff`).** *"You can barely tell it's supposed to be water, and the hydrant went away
  completely -- the cap should blow off and the water come out."*
  - **The water was 90 additive 13 cm sparks.** Additive light over a pale street is close to
    nothing. Now it is three layers:
    - a JET: an open tapering cylinder along the spout, with a shader of streaks scrolling up it
      and a bright silhouette;
    - a CROWN of big ALPHA-blended drops (their own pool, `wat`, since the sparks are additive)
      that leave the top of the column, spread and fall around it, growing .22 -> .5 m;
    - drops shed off the column's sides, a splash kicked up where drops land, and a 4.6 m puddle.
    It gushes for at least `minDur` 28 s whatever the file's `duration_s` says, surges in over
    .35 s and tapers over the last 15%.
  - **The hydrant** was swapped wholesale for its broken set and every chunk flew away. For
    `capOff` types, only the TOP chunk flies (`capUp` 11 m/s, spinning). The rest stand where it
    was, for good, and its collider stays.
  - **A sprite sheet** would help the CROWN and the splash most (drawn water has a shape the
    blobs cannot fake). The jet is better as the shader it is. A sheet of foam/splash bursts,
    white on transparent, would drop into the drop pool the way `FIRE.sheets` does.

- **A ROCKET SETS THE PEOPLE IT HITS ON FIRE, AND THE FIRE GOES WITH THEM (m210, `BURN`,
  `burnStart`, `burnStep`).** *"The fire burns where it hit them and stays there while they go
  flying off -- it should be on them, little bits and big bits, and follow them."*
  - Every body inside the blast (plan radius plus its own, and within reach vertically) gets
    `BURN.spots` flame spots on random bones of its own rig: hips, spines, head, upper/fore arms,
    upper/lower legs. Each spot has its own size (`size` .22-.62 of a full fire), flicker rate
    and phase, so it is not uniform.
  - They emit into the ordinary flame pool at the bone's WORLD position every frame, so the fire
    rides him through the flight, the landing and the get-up, and streams off him when he moves
    fast. Embers and smoke come off the highest spot. It builds in .25 s, burns 6-9 s and dies
    down over the last 2.5. Caught again, it starts over.
  - The rocket's own mark keeps only a LITTLE fire (`markLife` 5 s, k .38) when it went into
    somebody. A rocket into a wall or the street still lights the room or the ground as before.
  - `d.burn` is the hook for a running-on-fire clip. `mel.burn()` lights the nearest body.
  - Not built: burning does no damage and does not spread between bodies.

- **THE LADDER WAS THE CLIP, NOT THE PLACEMENT, AND THREE BUILDS FIXED THE WRONG THING (m209,
  `CLIPFIX`, `clipFix`).** *"His back is to the ladder and he's significantly off it -- every ladder
  is the same."* Measured, both halves:
  - **The volumes are right.** Paired by slot against the visual `climb` nodes in
    `toon_city_kit_buildings.glb`, every one of the 120 sits **0.35 m in front of its ladder along
    the node's +Z, 0.00 to the side**. So its 0.7 m axis is out of the wall, as `kitClimbAdd`
    already assumed. m208's axis swap is harmless, but it was never the cause.
  - **`climbing_Ladder`'s Hips are the cause.** Rotation ~180 deg about up (0.045, 0.990, 0.130,
    0.013 against the rest pose's identity) and translation x **33.9** against rest 0: about 65 cm
    to the side at his scale, facing AWAY from the wall. The game plays the Hips as authored, so
    every ladder drew him backwards and off the rungs whatever the placement did.
  `clipFix` turns that clip's Hips by `yaw` about up at load and puts the plan-mean of its
  translation back on the rest pose's (0, 1.29), keeping its height. The values are cloned first.
  **Three builds of placement fixes before anyone read the clip.** When every instance is wrong
  the same way, suspect the one thing they all share.
- **THE WARRIOR HIT HIM TWENTY FEET UP A LADDER (m209, `foeReachY`).** Every reach test was plan
  distance only. A blow now needs the target's feet between `below` .8 m under his and `above` .9
  of his height over them, and he will not START a swing at someone who is not.

- **THE RED WALL OF `w.x`, AND THE LADDER HE CLIMBED SIDE-ON (m208).**
  - `workerAI`: `navPath` can return `[]`, which is truthy, so `|| [spot]` never ran and
    `d.path[0].x` threw every frame he had a job. An empty plan now falls back to the marker, and
    `d.pi` is clamped into the path.
  - The ladder volumes are **0.7 x 0.8 m** (all 120, read off the file), so "the long horizontal
    axis runs along the wall" was decided by ten centimetres. Where the export has it the other
    way round he latched side-on, faced along the wall and hung in the air beside the rungs,
    which is his screenshot. `ladderFront` now probes BOTH axes: if the short one finds no wall
    and the long one finds a wall on exactly one side, they swap. It runs before the latch
    measures his side, because that measurement is along the axis it may swap.

- **EACH LADDER MEASURES ITS OWN FRONT, AND A HEAD IN A SLAB GOES DOWN (m207, `ladderFront`,
  `rbY`).**
  **Ladders:** *"I had to hold down to get on it, I couldn't tell which side."* m181 took the front
  from the piece's local +Z, and m195 flipped it for EVERY ladder because he said all were
  backwards. On this exterior one it is backwards again, so one sign cannot be right for all of
  them: the pieces are not all authored the same way round. `ladderFront` probes out of the volume
  on both sides (hn+.25 / hn+.6, at knee and mid height) against the real turned boxes. The side
  with the wall is the back. Measured offline over the kit city with real OBBs: **72 of 120 have a
  wall on exactly one side**. The rest (both sides or neither) are climbable from EITHER side, not
  guessed. `CLIMB.frontSign` and the extras `fx` are no longer read.
  **And he climbed beside it:** the latch kept wherever along the ladder he grabbed it, up to
  `ha` off-centre. That now eases to the middle.
  **Squeezing through joints:** `resolveBoxes` only ever pushed HORIZONTALLY, to the box's nearest
  side. For a floor slab he jumped up into, that side can be metres away, so a head clipping the
  underside at a room's edge was shoved sideways through the wall beside it. With `vert` (the
  player only), a box he is less far into vertically than horizontally is resolved on Y: head
  under it goes down and stops the rise, feet in its top go up onto it (tops under .6 m of
  penetration). Horizontal contact still wins at a wall, because first contact is always shallow
  sideways.

- **TREES AND SIGNS BEND ON THE FIRST HIT AND SNAP ON THE SECOND (m206, `BEND`, `bendBlast`,
  `bendRay`, `bendStep`, `bendSigns`).** *"A bend on first shot, and then a snap -- two hits."*
  - **Trees** are instances (101 nodes on six shared meshes, which the instancing pass already
    builds), so a bend is one instance matrix: `T(base) R T(-base) M`. A tree left un-instanced
    stays its own mesh and bends through `matrix` instead.
  - **Signs** are ONE merged mesh (`prop_wk_signs`, two primitives). At load it is split by
    CONNECTIVITY (weld at 1 mm, union-find over triangles) and the pieces are grouped by plan
    position, posts first so a plate joins the post under it. Decoded offline off the real file
    with the draco wrapper: **247 pieces -> 63 signs, every one grounded, 2.5-3.0 m tall.** They
    stay TWO draw calls. A sign is a list of vertex indices into those buffers, and a bend
    rewrites just those from a kept original.
  - **First hit:** leans away from the blow on a spring (`k`, `c`: it overshoots and settles).
    **Second hit:** topples about its base like a rod, `w' = (3g/2L) sin a`, with one bounce, to
    `fall` (trees 1.32 rad, so the crown lands before the trunk would). Its box and its impact
    triangles go with it (`looseUnpin`'s sweep), so a fallen one is not an obstacle. A rocket
    counts as both hits.
  - **A bolt stops ON them (`bendRay`)**, an upright cylinder each. A sign post has no impact
    surface, so without it a shot went straight through the sign it was aimed at.
  Wired to the bolt landing (the shot's own direction), the rocket (away from the blast) and the
  melee sweep (his facing). `BEND.cool` keeps one swing from counting twice.
  **Not built:** a fallen tree as something to stand on or collide with, and debris. It lies there.

- **POLES AND TRUNKS: A LIGHT POST'S BOX WAS ITS ARM, AND NARROW THINGS WERE COVER (m205,
  `PROPFIT`, `thinBox`).** *"The collide on street signs and trees is still just box collide and
  it doesn't fit ... he gets caught on them standing way away, covering on them."*
  **Measured:** `col_brk_lightpost_intact_mesh` is the whole silhouette, z -0.20..1.90 at 4-6 m
  up (the arm) over a 0.4 m base with a 0.14 m shaft. So its box was 0.64 x 2.1 m on the ground,
  it stopped him up to 1.9 m from the pole, and it was tall and wide enough for `wallFind`.
  - A breakable over `PROPFIT.pole` (2.5 m) keeps its full height and takes its FOOTPRINT from
    its own collider vertices in the bottom `base` third, which on the light post is the 0.4 m
    base.
  - A tree trunk's OBB (his json, root flare included, half ~.3) is scaled by `tree` .7.
  - Any box narrower than `wide` (1.1 m) on BOTH plan axes is never cover (`wallFind`) and never
    a ledge (`ledgeFind`). You run into it and that is all. Kit walls, chunks and doors are exempt.
  **Not found:** a stop-sign pole collider. The only tall things in `toon_city_obb.json` are four
  2.6 m boards (`solid_posts_190..193`) and the posts are 0.2 m bases. If he still snags on a
  sign, the COLLIDERS key will show which box it is.
  **Not built:** bending or shooting down signs and trees. Light posts are already breakables
  (hp 60).

- **m203'S STEADY CHEST SPUN THE SPINE, BECAUSE THE MIXER DOES NOT REWRITE A BONE WHOSE VALUE
  DID NOT CHANGE (m204, `spinePre`, `spineUndo`).** *"His spine is just rotating over and over."*
  three's `PropertyMixer.apply` calls `setValue` ONLY when the blended result differs from the one
  it wrote the frame before. The launcher pose is ONE KEY, so at full weight the spine's mixed
  value is constant, the mixer skips the write, and a correction premultiplied onto the bone after
  it stacks up once per frame. That is Shredworld's c128 "the spine unravelled", one repo over, and
  its answer holds: every edit on top of the mixer goes through `spinePre`, which remembers it, and
  `spineUndo` takes it back off right before `rig.mixer.update`. If the mixer writes, nothing is
  lost; if it does not, the bone is back where the edit started. `rigAirSpine` goes through it
  too. It had the same latent fault, which only a charge held through a long jump would show.
  **A bone edited after the mixer is only safe if something is guaranteed to rewrite it, and a
  constant clip is not.**

- **THE LAUNCHER: RIFLE-RUN LEGS, A STEADY CHEST, A STAND-IN KICK AND A LOCK-IN SOUND (m203,
  `rigSqSpine`, `ROCKETPOSE`, `ROCKET.arm`).**
  *"We are mixing the rocket animation with the run instead of the rifle run -- the unarmed run
  has a much more dramatic hip sway and it rocks the whole torso."* m189 chose the plain run
  because its hips were square like the pose's. m194 then made square poses ride the GAIT's hips
  (`__ups` over `__legh`), so every hip sway of the plain run went straight up through the chest.
  Now both the committed and the carried launcher use the rifle idle and rifle run legs. The
  rifle run's 35 deg hip twist and its smaller sway are taken OUT of the chest by `rigSqSpine`:
  after the mixer, the spine is premultiplied by `inv(H_live) * H_pose`, which is
  `rigAirSpine`'s closed-form correction applied on the ground. It is not a measured feedback
  loop, so it is not the spine twist the note below forbids. `steady` 1 is a chest that ignores
  the hips entirely.
  **The fire pose "not playing" is the FILE.** `rocket_launcher_fire` is still byte-identical to
  `rocket_launcher` (186 channels, one key, 0 differ, read off the raw GLB). So the switch
  happens and shows the hold. Until the re-export, a procedural pitch-back about his right axis
  over the shot beat (`ROCKETPOSE.kick`) stands in. It runs ONLY while `rocketSame()` says the two
  clips match, so it stands itself down when the real kickback lands.
  **Lock-in sound**: `metal_clang` dropped to a short clunk (r .52, .18 s) with a quiet
  `metal_ping` over it, played on the frame the trigger arms. `ROCKET.arm` is the list, so his own
  file replaces it with one line.
  TUNE panel: ROCKET steady / kick.

- **RES AUTO BLINKED BLACK ON EVERY STEP, BECAUSE IT RESIZED AFTER THE DRAW (m202).** Setting a
  canvas's size CLEARS it. `perfStep` ran after `renderer.render`, so every adjustment showed one
  cleared (black) frame. It runs before the render now, and the same frame draws into the new
  size. Stepping UP is also rate-limited (`upAt` 15 fps over target, at most every `upEvery` s),
  and a step down that bought nothing holds for 60 s, so the sharpness stops hunting.
  **His read:** toggling it "did not seem to save any frame rate". That is consistent with the
  frame not being fill bound, which is exactly the case AUTO backs off from. The 40-50 fps he saw
  after m200 is the body culling. The slide back to 25 "after some time" is unexplained. Heat
  throttling on a phone does exactly that and nothing here can measure it; the chip's `B` count
  and `pr` separate "more bodies on screen" and "resolution dropped" from it.
- **THE TUNE PANEL (m202, `TUNE`, the TUNE key on the FX bar).** *"I need those in a debug panel,
  I'm doing this on the phone."* Sliders for the rays and the dust. A row is one line in `TUNE`:
  label, object, key (`'w.1'` for an array index), range, step, and the pool to rebuild if the
  value is baked in at construction. The values are remembered in `mel.tune` by label, and RESET
  restores what the file ships.
  **The sliders are divs that read pointer x, not `<input type=range>`**, because the page is
  `touch-action: none` from the root down. The panel stops its own pointer events, so a drag on it
  never steers.

- **THE RAYS AND THE DUST KEYS DID NOTHING YOU COULD SEE, SO THEY ARE REBUILT (m201).** *"They
  still don't really seem like they do anything."*
  - **Rays.** m130's cards hung 46 m out along the sun axis and drew only while the lens faced
    the sun, at `gain` .12 x `pow(k, 3.2)`. With the camera pitched down and the sun at 30 deg
    that is about 2% opacity on top of a bright sky. Now there are seven BEAMS standing on the
    ground in front of the lens, leaning up along `_sunOff`. Each one fades in, holds and fades
    out over 5-9 s, then moves somewhere else in view. The vertex shader builds each card round
    the sun axis facing the camera from its own anchor, so it is still ONE draw call. Facing the
    sun adds `face`; it is no longer what lets them exist.
  - **Dust.** Near-white 3-7 px specks at alpha .16-.5 are the same value as a pale pavement and a
    pale sky, so switching them off changed nothing. It is now additive gold (it can only add
    light), a 13 m box so the same 520 are denser where you look, and a sharp per-mote
    `twinkle` pulse so a few catch the light at any moment. Motes within 2 m of the lens fade
    rather than becoming blobs.
  Taste numbers, all live: `mel.DUST.twinkle/twinkPow/size`, `mel.SHAFT.a/face/w/len`.

- **20 FPS WITH THE CROWD: TWO COSTS PAID FOR THINGS NOBODY COULD SEE (m200, `PERF`, `bodyCull`,
  `bodyMix`, `perfStep`, the `RES` key).**
  1. **Every body was drawn, shadowed and animated wherever it was.** Bodies are
     `frustumCulled = false`, so all 22 were drawn behind the camera, drawn again into the sun's
     shadow map, and had their mixer evaluated every frame. Now each skinned mesh gets three's own
     `computeBoundingSphere` on the SKINNED pose, inflated x`PERF.inflate` so a swing stays
     inside it, and culling goes back on, which culls the shadow pass too. That is two bodies a
     frame, because the sphere runs every vertex through the bones. Off screen the mixer runs at
     `animHz` with the time ACCUMULATED, so nothing falls behind. Within `near` of him it always
     runs, because a hit behind the lens still reads the limbs.
  2. **The resolution was a fixed 2x with MSAA**, which on a phone is the fill rate. `RES` on the
     FX bar cycles AUTO / 2 / 1.5 / 1.2 and is remembered in `mel.res`. AUTO walks the pixel ratio
     toward `target` fps, and **it checks that dropping it helped**. If a step down buys under
     `gain` fps, the frame is not fill bound: it steps back up and holds for `hold` seconds, so it
     never blurs the picture for nothing. The chip reads `pr1.65` (with `h` while holding) and
     `B<seen>/<bodies>`.
  **Not measured here.** Nothing in this container has a GPU, so which of the two was the 20 fps
  is a device question. `RES 2` against `RES AUTO`, and `mel.PERF.cull = 0`, are the two A/Bs.

- **HIS TWO FIRE SHEETS, ON A SWITCH (m198, `FIRE.sheets`, `fireSheet`, `?fire=N`).** *"I want to
  try the second one, but it's five by two rather than four by four."* The shape is not a problem.
  The lookup is in UV, so any `grid` works, and so do cells that are not a whole number of pixels.
  - `fire_sprites_01.png`: 1254 square, RGBA, 4 x 4, so each cell is 313.5 px. It is ONE tongue's
    whole life (kindle, swell, curl, gutter into smoke), which is exactly what a card playing the
    book once over its life wants.
  - `fire_sprites_02.png`: 900 x 360, RGB on black, 5 x 2 at 180 px. It is ten separate bursts
    rather than a sequence, so a card cross-fades between unrelated drawings, which reads as
    boiling rather than as a tongue.
  0 is the drawn flipbook. `pick` 2 is the default because he asked for it first. `?fire=0/1/2`
  and `mel.fireSheet(n)` swap live, because which fire looks right is his call. The chip's fire
  token reads `S1`/`S2` when a sheet of his is playing, and `NO FIRE SHEET n` if one failed to load.

- **EVERYBODY IN THE KIT WORLDS, AND THAT IS WHAT THE VIRUS GUN WAS MISSING (m197, `KCROWD.crowd`,
  `crowdDeal`).** *"I meant everybody, like the warrior aliens, and I'm unable to change anybody
  into a warrior with the virus gun."* One fault, not two. `alienKinds()` only offers a kind
  whose prototype LOADED (`FOE.P`), and m196 loaded only the civilians. With no alien to turn
  anyone into, `virusOK` refused everybody, while the gun itself was fine.
  The kit worlds now load what the other worlds load: the mace and warrior, hick, hobo, skater,
  biker, officer, the nine civilians and Clancy. The one exception is SHE, who has no collider and
  only walks a circuit that has been proven clear. `KCROWD.crowd` is Weirdport's table at about
  half size, 22 bodies in all.
  The round-robin deal is `crowdDeal` now, shared with `wpPopulate` rather than copied, and
  `crowdWant` counts the table the same way for both. `?crowd=0` is still the empty world.
- **FIRE IS A FLIPBOOK OF TONGUES THROUGH A HEAT RAMP (m197, `FLAMEBOOK`, `FIRE.body/lick/ember/
  glow`).** *"More fiery, rather than no-detail subtle glowing balls."* m192 was one soft round
  dot tinted yellow to red, which is a colour with no SHAPE.
  Now 16 flame tongues are drawn once at load from value noise on a 4 x 4 atlas (0.2 s in node):
  rounded base, tapering tip, turbulence climbing it, and the base letting go late in the life.
  Each card plays the book once over its own life, blending between adjacent frames.
  **THE COLOUR COMES FROM THE TEXTURE'S INTENSITY, NOT THE PARTICLE.** It goes through a heat ramp
  (black, red, orange, yellow, white), which is what puts a white core inside a red edge on every
  card. The first draw was a flat white slab because the core-to-edge falloff was a step. It has
  to be a GRADIENT or the ramp has nothing to walk across. Looked at as a rendered atlas before
  shipping, not argued.
  Four layers in ONE draw call: `aFrame` < 0 is not a frame (-1 is an ember, -2 the ground glow).
  **HIS SHEET DROPS IN**: `images/fire_sheet.png`, frame 0 top-left, row-major, `FIRE.grid`
  (8 x 8 default), flame on black or transparent. A 404 is silence and the drawn book stays. The
  chip's fire token gains an `S` when his sheet is the one in use. It is not in `ASSETS` until a
  bump has hashed it.

- **THE KIT WORLDS HAVE A CROWD, AS A FRAME-RATE EXPERIMENT (m196, `KCROWD`, `kitPopulate`).**
  *"I'm thinking we try adding the civilians in and see how much it crashes the frame rate, also
  maybe Clancy."* Both kit worlds loaded only the construction worker. Now they load all nine
  `CIVILS` (`KCROWD.per` each) plus Clancy beside the spawn. The biker is loaded as the CLIP DONOR
  ONLY (`BIKER.at = []`), because every civil borrows his clips.
  **EVERY `at` TABLE IS TEST-SITE COORDINATES**, and `wpPool` walks the full `TRI` grid bounds, so
  placement is the kit's own. `kitPopulate` throws darts within 70 m (tkit) or 34 m (kit) of the
  spawn. It keeps a spot only on level street-level ground (`KCROWD.top`), outside a kit building
  (`kitInside`), and clear of the collider at a body's radius. Then `wpSpread` spreads them
  farthest-point. It is seeded, so the same crowd appears every load.
  **THE A/B IS A URL**: `?crowd=0` (or `KCROWD.on = 0`) gives back the empty world. Read the fps in
  the chip both ways. The chip's `C<n>` is how many civilians were placed, and `KIT CROWD n/9`
  appears if the ground ran out.

- **THE LADDER FRONT WAS BACKWARDS ON EVERY LADDER, AND MY GEOMETRY TEST SAID IT WAS RIGHT (m195,
  `CLIMB.frontSign`).** *"They're all the wrong side -- you can walk up the inside and not the
  outside."* m181 made the front the piece's local +Z and backed it with a measurement: which side
  of each ladder has a collider box within 0.3-0.7 m. Re-run now through both worlds it still says
  the same -- the open side is +Z on 82 of 83 decided kit-city ladders (37 undecided: no wall that
  close on EITHER side) and 8 of 8 on the row. **He is standing at them and it is wrong on all of
  them**, so that test measures something other than which way the rungs face; a gap behind the
  rungs is the likeliest reason (the undecided 37 show there is room back there). Flipped to -Z,
  as a dial rather than a rewrite: `mel.CLIMB.frontSign = 1` is m181. **A geometry proxy is not
  the thing it stands in for** -- when he says every one is wrong, the device outranks the probe.

- **A HELD POSE THAT IS SQUARE TO THE HIPS MUST NOT OWN THE HIPS' ROTATION (m194, `UPS`/`LEGH`,
  `isUpperSq`, `upKey`, `legKey`, `SPLIT.upSq`).** *"The hips rotation is missing -- they move up
  and down with no rotation, very static hips with the legs moving back and forth."*
  **THE FILE HAS IT AND THE ORDINARY GAIT PLAYS IT.** Hips rotation per cycle, world frame:
      walk_fwd     twist 19.3  tilt  9.0  lean  6.0 deg
      run_fwd      twist 16.7  tilt 29.8  lean  7.5
      run_fwd_fast twist 16.2  tilt 27.4  lean  3.9
      Running_fast_stride  twist 32.3  tilt 29.0  lean 17.1
  `normaliseClips` keeps every rotation track, and the only runtime write to a hips or spine bone
  is `rigAirSpine`. **What froze them is the half-body split**: `isUpper` hands the Hips ROTATION
  to the `__up` half, which is right for a BLADED stance (m184: the rifle poses stand on hips
  turned 35-62 deg and their spine is authored against that) and wrong for a pose held square over
  a gait. The launcher's two are single keys and the swap reach is not a stance, so carrying the
  launcher or reaching into the bag put STILL hips under running legs. Those three now use `__ups`
  (spine-up without the hips) over `__legh` (the legs with the hips' rotation), everywhere a held
  pose is laid on legs -- the gait, the strafes, the air (no spine correction needed: the pose
  rides the jump's own hips) and the board. The bladed poses keep the old pair on purpose.
  **What still holds the hips to the pose**: aiming or charging the BLASTER while strafing -- that
  is the rifle stance and is the m184 rule, not this bug.

- **THE STRIDE LEAPS: CONTACTS AT THE PLANTED-FOOT RATE, THE AIR AT `hang` OF IT, AND A LIFT
  THROUGH EACH AIRBORNE PART (m193, `GAIT.runSets.stride.leap`, `leapContact`, `leapAir`).**
  *"Are you not using the Y of the hips?"* -- we are, and it was checked rather than argued:
  `normaliseClips` keeps `Hips.position`, `deDrift` only takes the X/Z ramp, and nothing writes
  the hips or re-grounds the root at runtime. What flattens the leap is that an IN-PLACE clip's
  airtime is its playback rate: a 0.5 s step played at 3.4x is 0.15 s of foot, foot, foot.
  *"Slow the clip down, but he travels farther per leap."* So the stride runs at two rates:
      contacts (clip phase .25-.50 left, .69-.96 right, read off the ankle/ball heights at 48 fps)
                at `contactRef` 2.62 -- the planted foot's own measured speed, and a sweep through a
                real mixer (1.8 .. 3.4) has its minimum slide exactly there
      the air   at `hang` (.35) of that, and LIFTED on a sine arc of `lift` (.15 m) -- the clip keeps
                the swinging and the trailing foot at floor height between contacts, and the lift is
                what clears them
  Measured, pure stride, through the real mixer:
      7.2 m/s   a leap every 0.24 s covering 1.71 m, airborne 68%, contact foot slide 1.58 m/s
                (22%), lowest foot in the air 6.9 cm      -- flat at 3.4x it was 0.15 s / 1.1 m and
                the lowest foot slid 117% of his speed
  The shared gait phase takes the stride's rate weighted by its share of the blend, so a run easing
  into it eases into the rhythm; the footsteps take the leap's own cycle (`leapCycle`).
  **STRIDE IS THE DEFAULT AGAIN** -- but `mel.run` is remembered per phone, so a phone that tapped
  FAST in m191 stays on FAST until the RUN key is tapped. `GAIT.leapOn = 0` is the flat version.

- **ROCKETS SET THINGS ON FIRE, AND HIS KIT ALREADY SAID WHERE (m192, `FIRE`, `fireIgnite`,
  `fireDouse`, `fireNear`, `KROOMS`, `KFIREPOS`).** *"Making things light on fire with the rocket
  launcher, because eventually when I put in the firefighter he would come and put out fires."*
  Every kit building carries `room` markers with `fire_spawn: true` -- 934 in the kit city, 89 on
  the generated row, 12 in the house -- plus a `fire_truck_park` (with `yaw_deg`) and a
  `fire_hose_stand`. `buildKit` collects them by the building prefix on the node's own name
  (`kit_000_...`, `BKG0_...`, bare = `house`). A rocket that HITS something lights the nearest
  unburnt room within `igniteR` (6 m, within 3.2 m of height); failing that a ground fire where it
  landed, which burns out on its own in 12 s. A room fire grows to full and spreads to the nearest
  room of the SAME building every `spreadT` (9 s), up to `perBld` (8), and **burns until it is put
  out** -- which is the firefighter's job: `fireNear(x, z, r)` finds one, `fireDouse(f, amount)`
  takes strength off (1 = a full fire; it goes out with steam at 0), `KFIREPOS[f.bld]` is where to
  park and stand. `mel.fire()` / `mel.douse()` do the same where he stands.
  Probed through the real kit world: a rocket into BKG1 lit `L0_1_0`, 40 s later 8 of its rooms
  were burning at full, and four douses of .25 put one out.
  **Flames are their own additive pool** (a spark falls and holds its colour; a flame rises,
  shrinks and cools yellow -> orange -> red), smoke is the shared pool, dark. The chip says
  `F<burning>/<started>`. **Not yet:** fire hurts nobody, burns no walls, and does not catch on
  bodies -- those are rules still to decide.

- **THE STRIDE CLIP DRAGS ITS SWING FOOT, THE WALK BAND OUTRAN THE WALK, AND THE SLAM CRATER WAS
  NEVER SHRUNK (m191, `GAIT.runSets`, the RUN key, `DECAL.slam`).** *"The new run is actually worse
  -- it looks sped up way more in game, his feet are sticking to the ground... a problem with him
  walking at a certain speed... the slam mark is still absolutely unreasonably massive, you said you
  fixed it."* I had not: m188 halved the BOLT's mark and the slam has its own size.
  **MEASURED BY DRIVING THE REAL CLIPS THROUGH A REAL MIXER** (the `zap.glb` animations on its own
  node tree at his in-game scale, the shipped band weights, rates and phase sync, the body moving at
  each speed) and reading how fast the lowest foot slides across the ground:
      walk band, m190     from ~1 m/s the walk (0.60 m/s at 1x, capped 0.96) slid 70-100% of speed
      walk band, m191     walkAt .8 / runAt 1.4 / sprintAt 3.6 -> 26% at 1.0 m/s
      run_fwd_fast        19-40% at 4.6-7.2 m/s
      Running_fast_stride 117-240% at EVERY rate swept (ref 1.2 to 3.0, uncapped)
  **THE STRIDE'S NUMBER IS NOT A RATE PROBLEM.** Frame by frame, its swinging foot comes forward at
  floor height -- ~0.4 m of travel within a centimetre of the ground for the first fifth of each
  stride, as low as the planted foot -- so the lowest foot is always the one gliding forward. That
  is "his feet are sticking to the ground" and it is in the clip. **FAST (m188's run) is the
  default again; STRIDE is one tap on the RUN key in the FX row** (remembered per phone,
  `runSetUse`), at ref 3.0 with a 3.4 ceiling so it is never capped into a slide on top of that.
  Lift the swing foot in the export and flip the key.
  **THE CRATER** was `k` .72 of the 3.4 m slam radius each side, **4.9 m across** plus a rubble ring
  1.9 m out. Now .24 (~1.6 m), the ring .30 and the rubble at .42 of its size.

- **HIS OWN BOARD POSES REPLACE THE BORROWED ONES, ROLE BY ROLE (m190, `SK8.own`, `SK8.dip`).**
  *"The borrowed ones look kinda whack on his proportions, so I exported them on his skeleton. Up,
  down, middle and turbulent -- same animation, knees at different heights. Down is before he
  ollies, up is full extension afterwards, middle is most skating, turbulent is turning. I forgot the
  pushing one, I'll add it now."* Head height in each, off the file: down 0.41, turbulent 0.58,
  middle 0.59, up 0.66 -- which is his description exactly.
      rolling    middle, giving way to turbulent on the DECK's own turn rate (`p.bTurn`, damped;
                 `own.turnAt`..`turnFull` rad/s). `p.turnRate` is the foot gait's and never ran here
      the tap    `SK8.dip` (.09 s) in down, THEN the pop. It is a real delay on the ollie and it is
                 the wind-up he drew; `mel.SK8.dip = 0` pops on the tap. Rolling off something
                 mid-dip cancels it rather than popping on the far side
      air        up (a body flip still owns the whole body, as before)
      landing    down for `own.land`, the absorb (the borrowed landing one-shot is not started)
      rail       down
      push       his, the moment a clip named in `own.push` exists; the borrowed pair until then
  **Each role falls back to the borrowed clip on its own**, so an export that drops one is a
  borrowed pose, never a missing body. All of them are in `SPLIT.legsRaw`, so the blaster's `__up`
  still composes over them on the board. **The push name is a guess** (`Skateboarding_push` /
  `_pushing`) -- if his arrives under another name it is one string in `own.push`.

- **THE LONG STRIDE IS THE SPRINT, THE GAIT IS PHASE-SYNCED, THE LADDER HAS ITS CLIP, AND THE
  LAUNCHER IS A SLOT (m189, `GAIT.sprintHi`, `gaitSync`, `CLIMB.ref`, `ROCKET`, `rocketUp`).**
  *"I added a run fast with a longer stride -- make sure he's actually using that instead of just
  speeding up the normal run... a weird blending at lower speeds, his feet start to stutter... a
  climbing ladder animation... an alien launcher with a hold and a fired pose -- a hybrid, spine up
  over the rifle hips and legs."*
  **WHAT THE NEW FILE HAS** (diffed against m188's): `Running_fast_stride` 1.00 s, `climbing_Ladder`
  0.83 s, `rocket_launcher` and `rocket_launcher_fire` (one key each), and four `Skateboarding_*`
  clips nothing uses yet. 54 -> 62, none lost.
  **THE STRIDE, MEASURED** (toes relative to hips, frame by frame, at x1.926):
      run_fwd_fast          0.50 s cycle   foot travel 0.93   stance 4.84 m/s
      Running_fast_stride   1.00 s cycle   foot travel 1.15   stance 3.19 m/s
  so `sprintRef` 3.00 on the old calibration -- a longer and SLOWER-cadence stride, which is the
  point. At `MOVE.max` 7.2 it wants ~3.4x, and `tsHi` 1.6 would have capped it into a slow-motion
  skate, so it has its own ceiling, **`GAIT.sprintHi` 2.6**: 2.6 strides a second (the old fast
  run capped at 3.2) with the feet sliding about a fifth at full tilt.
  **THE STUTTER WAS TWO CLOCKS.** Walk (1.42 s) and run (0.75 s) blended at their own rates put
  one clip's feet forward while the other's were back. Now every moving clip shares one phase
  advancing at the weighted cycle rate, placed by where ITS left foot is furthest forward --
  measured: walk .259, run .278, stride .250 -- and held at time scale 0 while it is written.
  `GAIT.sync = 0` is the old behaviour. **What sync cannot fix is the walk band**: at `walkAt` 1.3
  the scaled walk (ref 0.60) wants 2.2x and is capped at 1.6, so the top of the walk still slides.
  **THE LADDER** plays `climbing_Ladder` at the rate he climbs: the gripping hand's travel past the
  hips says **0.73 m/s** at 1x (x1.926), capped at `CLIMB.hi` 3.2 because `CLIMB.speed` 3.4 asks ~6x.
  **THE LAUNCHER** is `models/weapons/alien_launcher.glb`, `weapon_root_right` / `weapon_tip_2` at
  (-14.3102, 0, 0) -- the blaster's pair, so it parents with identity. No modes and no charge: hold
  up to aim, release fires a rocket (`ROCKET`: 30 m/s, 3.6 m blast, up to 5 bodies, 2.2x the bolt's
  damage on bodies/walls/props, the explosion file, a camera knock, smoke and fire behind it) with
  `ROCKET.cool` between shots. It rides `stepBolts` as a flag, so every collider the bolt knows
  about stops it. Probed: fired at the BKG1 front from 5.8 m, landed in 0.20 s, 84 chunks gone.
  **THE TWO POSES ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL IN HIS EXPORT** -- one key at 1/24 s on all 186 channels, the
  same values -- so the kickback never left the file and the fire beat looks like the hold until it
  is re-exported. Both are wired (`CLIPS.rocket` / `rocketFire`, `SPLIT.up`).
  **AND THE LEGS ARE THE ORDINARY GAIT'S, NOT THE RIFLE'S, ON PURPOSE.** The pose's hips are square
  (0 deg) and `rifle_run`'s are bladed (-34.6); the `__up` half carries the hips ROTATION
  (`isUpper`), so rifle legs under a square pose point 35 deg off the way he is going. Carried, he
  walks/runs/strides on the plain gait's `__legs` (phase-synced); aiming, the strafes, the back-run
  and the plain run; in the air, `in_air`'s. `rocketUp()` is the one reader of which pose.

- **THE COLLISION GRID HELD INDICES, AND AUTO-FIRE INTO A KIT CITY BROKE IT FOR EVER (m188, `boxDel`,
  `BGRID`).** A screen of `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'b.minx')` @ `groundAt` and
  `'b.tri'` @ `boxRay`, repeating every frame. `boxGrid` filed each box as its INDEX in `BOXES`, and
  every splice between a removal and the next rebuild shifted each index after it -- so a bucket
  handed back the wrong box, or `undefined` off the end. m184's loose props made it reachable: a bolt
  unpins a bag (`looseUnpin` splices, `brkDirty` defers the rebuild to `brkStep`) and the NEXT bolt,
  same frame, ray-casts the stale grid. The throw left the frame loop BEFORE `brkStep`, so the
  rebuild that would have healed it never ran, and it threw every frame after. **The grid holds the
  boxes themselves now**, and every removal goes through `boxDel`, which marks the box `_off` so it
  is not handed back in the window before the rebuild (`boxGrid` clears the mark on everything still
  in `BOXES`, which is what makes a repaired chunk live again). **A deferred rebuild is only safe if
  the stale structure is still CORRECT, merely conservative** -- indices were neither.
- **THE WORKER PLANS A PATH, SWINGS FASTER, AND THE BOLT'S MARK IS HALF THE SIZE (m188, `navPath`,
  `NAV`, `WORKER.cut`, `DECAL.bolt`).** *"He gets stuck on walls a lot and just infinitely walks
  towards them... kind of slow with the repairs... trim the swings so it's just the swing... the hit
  impact mark on the asphalt is kind of huge."*
  **THE PATH IS A LAZY A\*** over the real collider on a 0.6 m grid: a cell is only asked about (one
  `boxesNear`) when the search reaches it, blocked means a box he cannot step onto or walk under
  within his radius, and the corners are string-pulled so he walks straight lines. Replans from
  where he is after `NAV.replan` s pressed against something; after `NAV.tries` failed plans he
  steps to the marker (the chip counts both: `p<plans>` and `!<gave up>`). Probed offline on the
  generated row: from the street to walls on the far side of BKG0 -- 7 of 7 reached on ONE plan,
  0 give-ups, 12-38 ms for the whole trip's planning.
  **THE SWING TRIMS ARE MEASURED**: the hammer tip's world path through a real mixer, 24 fps --
  `1-handed_swing_01` raises f9-f20 and strikes f20-f23 (so [8, 26]), `1-handed_swing_02` is
  fastest at f8 ([2, 14]), `2-handed-swing` dips to f8 (his "move his arm" lead-in), raises f9-f15,
  strikes f16-f19 ([9, 22]). `AnimationUtils.subclip` at build, the contact fraction recomputed
  per cut, and `KREP.rate` 1.35 on top: a swing is 0.4-0.55 s against 1.0-2.3. He never plays the
  same cut twice running (the end and the start of a cut are different poses; restarting on itself
  pops, and a DIFFERENT clip blends).
  **HE HAS NO RUN CLIP** -- `WORKER.runClips` is the hook (`run_fwd` / `running` / `run`, first
  found wins, used past `runFar` metres), and his walk went 1.3 -> 1.6 m/s meanwhile. `runRef` 3.5
  is a guess until `npm run gait` measures the clip.
  **THE BOLT'S DECAL** is `DECAL.bolt` .5 on the atlas `size_m`; the trail, the slam and the hammer
  are untouched.

- **THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER PUTS WALLS BACK (m187, `WORKER`, `workerAI`, `kitRestore`, `KREP`).**
  *"The construction worker is gonna go and rebuild buildings that are broken... for now just have
  one guy in there -- when you break it, maybe he walks up to the building and starts repairing it."*
  **HE IS A TABLE AND A BRAIN**, the hobo's shape: the bolt, the swing, the flight and the get-up
  reach him with no new code, and the brain is idle -> nearest wall with a dead chunk inside
  `KREP.range` -> walk to its marker -> face it and swing, **one chunk back per swing, lowest
  first**, on the swing's contact frame (`WORKER.hitAt`, a look-at-it number per clip).
  **HIS MARKERS WERE ALREADY IN THE FILES** -- `nav_repair__<wall>` with `extras.wall_piece`
  naming the wall by `piece_id`: 1,344 in the kit city, 138 on the generated row, 20 on the house,
  and **every one names a real wall** (checked against the piece ids). They are ground-floor walls
  only; an upper-floor wall falls back to a step out from the wall on the side `kitInside` says is
  outside, and he fixes it FROM THE STREET -- a stated shortcut until there is scaffolding or a lift.
  **THE HAMMER IS THE MACE'S RULE**: `weapon_root -> weapon_tip` (27.8, 0, 0) in both files, so it
  parents onto his joint with identity and nothing about where it sits is typed.
  **A REPAIR IS A KILL RUN BACKWARDS, AND IT NEEDED THE ORIGINALS KEPT.** A batched wall's range is
  saved on its FIRST collapse (`B.orig` in `kitCollapse`); a cloned wall keeps the shared source it
  was cloned from (`userData.kOrig`, in `kitClone` and in `kitSwap` for a twin). Restoring puts the
  vertices back, the chunk box back in `BOXES`, `hp` back to `hp0`, and regrids once.
  **What it dropped stays dropped** -- ivy, an AC unit, an awning are gone for good, which is honest
  and is the next thing to do if he wants a repaired wall to look new.
  Probed offline over the real kit world (`buildKit` on his files, a fabricated body because no
  harness here builds a skin): five chunks knocked out of `BKG1/L0_W2_0_s`, the worker walks from
  the street to its marker in about 4 s, the wall is 13/13 again, the boxes are back (2375 -> 2380)
  and **0 vertices differ from the original**.
  **NOT MEASURED: his walk.** `walkRef` 1.2 is a guess -- `npm run gait` on his file would measure
  it, and his feet may slide until it does. `KREP.stuck` (5 s) steps him to the marker if he walks
  into something, because there is no pathfinding here: better a little magic than a man walking
  into a wall for ever. **Only the kit worlds load him** (at `WORKER.atKit` / `atTK`, beside each
  spawn), and in the kit city he only goes for holes within 90 m -- `mel.worker()` brings him to
  you. The chip says `REP<state><chunks fixed>`.
  **NOT BUILT:** the construction vehicle and a crew. His clip set already carries `driving`,
  `enter_vehicle` and `exit_vehicle` for it.

- **THE SLAM SPLITS THE GROUND AND THE BOLT SCORCHES WHAT IT SKIMS (m186, `DECAL.slam`,
  `slamMark`, `DECAL.trail`, `boltTrail`).** *"When you slam down I'd like it to leave a decal
  like you split the ground -- I'll probably make a custom one. And the blaster skims along the
  ground; it'd be cool if it left a trail."* Both on the impact-mark atlas that already exists.
  **The slam** puts a crater at his feet sized off `SLAM.r` (so the mark says how far the blow
  caught) with rubble round it, on the floor read off the collider, and not at all if there is
  no floor within a metre. **`DECAL.slam.kind` is `crack` and it is tried first**: a mark of kind
  `crack` added to `impact_marks.json` is used with no code change; until then, the craters.
  **The trail** is a small scorch every 0.85 m (2.55 m for the rapid fire) while the ball is within
  1.35 m of the floor, sized by the charge, gone in 6 s. **The pool went 40 -> 96** and marks took a
  per-mark life, so a trail cannot recycle the impact marks out from under the walls. The atlas
  is indexed by NAME as well as kind now (`scorch`, `crater`, `goo` ...) because `blast` is a
  scorch two times in three. **The atlas only loads in the toon city, the kit city and the kit
  world**, so the test site and Weirdport leave no marks, as before.

- **HE SANK INTO THE GRASS BECAUSE THE COLLISION GRASS HAD HOLES WHERE THE OLD BUILDINGS STOOD (m185,
  `kcGroundCapture`, `KCITY.fill`).** *"He just sinks through the grass, so the collider is not
  doing a great job."* Measured, not guessed: the collision grass (`ground_lots`) is flat at 0.23
  and the drawn grass (`ground_wr_lots`) at 0.20 -- so where both exist he stands 3 cm ABOVE it.
  The sink was the gaps: sampling round all sixty old lots outside the new kit footprints, **4,812 of
  17,046 points had no ground but `road_city` at 0**, 20 cm under the drawn grass. The old
  buildings covered those patches, so nobody ever needed collision there, and the kit buildings
  are smaller than the ones they replaced. The VISUAL file's own lots and dirt cover them, so
  `buildTCity` captures their triangles before the merge and `buildKCityCol` adds them under
  everything (the kit city now loads the visual BEFORE the collider). After: 0 of 17,046.
  **His fix, if he wants the collision file to be the whole truth, is to fill `ground_lots` under
  the old footprints** -- the capture then adds nothing new and costs nothing.

- **LOOSE PROPS FLY, AND A CHARGE HELD THROUGH A JUMP KEEPS THE GUN UP (m184, `LOOSE`,
  `looseRay`, `looseBlast`, `stepLoose`, `rigAirSpine`).** *"I want to be able to shoot small
  objects -- the trash bag, the rubble. It could go flying off or pop into small trash. See how one
  of the hit marks is floating in the air?"* and *"when you're holding a charge and jump, a hybrid:
  the legs and hips of the in-air animation, still holding the charge -- rotate the spine so the
  upper torso aligns."*
  **THE FLOATING MARK WAS A BOLT FLYING THROUGH A BAG WITH NO COLLISION.** Measured against his
  collision file: collision under 2 of 42 trash bags, 1 of 183 soda cans, 0 of 76 cups -- so the
  bolt passed through and marked whatever was behind. The piles (20/20), rubble (15/15) and boxes
  (24/24) do have collision, at their art's height. None of the six is tagged `breakable`.
  **SO THEY ARE CLAIMED BY NAME (`LOOSE.re`) IN `buildTCity`'s ONE LOOP**, beside `brkClaim`: a bolt
  tests them as spheres along its segment (nearest of surface, box, loose wins) and a blast or a
  swing within reach knocks them flying -- the instance slot zeroes and a real Mesh of the same
  geometry takes off, tumbles, bounces off the real ground and LIES THERE to be kicked again. Mass
  per kind: a can goes a long way, rubble shuffles. **The first time one moves its collider goes**
  (`looseUnpin`): the OBB boxes centred in it, and every walkable and impact triangle whose middle
  is in it above its base, collapsed to a point far below the world -- or you walk into a bag that
  is not there. A bolt that stops ON a bag leaves no mark. `LOOSE.max` 60 detached; older resting
  ones shrink out. **POPPING INTO SMALL TRASH IS AN ASSET**: tag the node `breakable` and give the
  breakables library a broken version, and `brkBreak` does it with no code.
  **THE AIR CHARGE IS THE COMMITTED OVERRIDE ONE STATE UP**: `in_air` joined `SPLIT.legs`, so a
  committed jump plays the weapon pose's `__up` over `in_air__legs`. **Measured off the clips, the
  hips disagree**: in the armature frame the in-air hips sit at -15 deg, the shot (which `rifle_aim`
  is taken from) at -62 and the hammer wind-up at -74.5 -- so the same spine over the jump's hips
  points the gun 47-60 degrees off. `rigAirSpine` turns the first spine bone by `inv(Hjump) *
  Hpose` after the mixer, with Hpose read off the pose clip's own Hips track at its current time,
  faded by the pose's weight and kept alive while the jump's legs still have any, so the landing
  does not snap. **It is not the deleted aim spine-twist**: that was a feedback loop chasing a
  moving bearing; this is an offset between two clips with nothing measured back, on a bone the
  `__up` half keys every frame so it cannot accumulate. Nothing here could build a skin to look.

- **WITH THE X-RAY ON, A KIT BUILDING NEVER PULLS THE CAMERA IN (m183, `camHit(..., skipKit)`).**
  *"When you rotate so a rim of the roof ledge is between you and the camera, the camera goes way
  in -- I don't know that there's any point of it doing that since now we have other things to
  deal with that."* Right: shortening the boom in front of an obstacle was the only answer before
  the x-ray, and it turned a rooftop shot into a close-up of his face every time the parapet came
  round. `camBlock` now skips every kit box (`b.kit`, chunks, parts) while `KCUT.xOn` is set, so the
  boom keeps its length and the parapet between them dithers instead. Hero buildings, props and
  the old city still stop it -- they have no x-ray. CUT / CLOSE / OFF modes collide as before.

- **THE X-RAY LEAVES THE CAMERA ALONE, AND ITS CIRCLE IS HIS SIZE (m182, `KIT.xrayW`, `KCUT.camY`).**
  *"When you go inside a building the camera angle changes, and since we have the x-ray I don't
  think it should. On the roof it x-rays through the side rim of the wall -- there's no need."*
  Two faults, both mine from m181:
  **1. 'xray' borrowed the cutaway's lens** (lifted to `cutEl`, pulled to `cutDist`). Now only 'cut'
  and 'close' move the camera. What xray keeps is `KCUT.cam` -- the boom may pass through the
  building he is in from his own floor up (`camY`), because a lens stopped by the wall behind him
  is a close-up of his shoulder, and that wall is exactly the one the x-ray thins.
  **2. The circle was .30 of the SCREEN**, which at his usual distance is a cone metres wider than
  his body, so a parapet standing BESIDE him on a roof -- nearer the lens, covering nothing -- fell
  inside it and dithered. It is a radius in METRES at his depth now (`xrayW` 1.15 outside,
  `xrayWIn` 2.4 indoors), converted with the live fov, so only what is actually in front of him
  thins. A tighter test (is this fragment really occluding HIS pixels) needs his depth per pixel,
  which is a render pass this game does not have; the body-sized cone is the cheap version of it.

- **THE X-RAY, LADDERS WITH A FRONT, AND THE ROOF PULL-OUT (m181, `KCUT.x*`, `kitXrayStep`,
  `L.fx/fz`, `kit.high`).** *"When you get inside, at certain camera angles it just completely
  disappears. I was picturing a radial gradient from completely open on the outside to semi-
  transparent in the centre -- you can see through the wall but the wall still looks like it's
  there. When you're on a ladder you should only ever be able to climb the front side. On rooftops
  we want to be able to see who and what's going on down on the ground."*
  **THE X-RAY IS NOW THE DEFAULT (`KIT.inCam = 'xray'`) AND IT NEVER ERASES ANYTHING.** m179's cut
  discarded everything of the building above his storey, which from a lot of angles is most of the
  picture -- the roof, the walls, where the building even ends. Now: any kit surface NEARER THE LENS
  THAN HE IS, ABOVE HIS FEET, inside a screen circle round him, is a 4x4 ordered dither whose coverage
  runs from `xrayMin` (.32) at the middle to solid at the rim. A dither and not blending, so the wall
  still writes depth, nothing has to sort, and it is one branch in the fragment shader of every kit
  material (`kitCutMat`, so the batch, the twins and -- through `instanceMatrix` -- the instanced
  parts all get it). **"Above his feet" is load-bearing**: the floor in front of him is nearer the
  lens than he is and must stay a floor. It runs OUTSIDE as well, so a building between the lens and
  him thins the same way, and on a roof the parapet in front of him does.
  The camera half of m179 is kept for now -- he said so (*"not positive we even need this smart
  camera if we have x-ray walls, but leave it"*): inside, the lens still lifts and pulls to
  `cutDist`, and may pass through the upper storeys (`KCUT.cam`, split from the discard). The FX
  key's INSIDE chip cycles XRAY / CUT / CLOSE / OFF.
  **A LADDER'S FRONT IS THE PIECE'S OWN LOCAL +Z, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.** Every ladder
  carries `exit`, and against the geometry: the exterior ladders have their wall on the `exit` side,
  which is local -Z (57 of 57 the probe could decide); the interior hatch ladders have `exit` on
  +Z and, on the 6 that stand against a wall, the wall on -Z. Two different `exit` conventions,
  one front. It is copied onto the climb volume by slot and the latch refuses the other side:
  120/120 city ladders latch from the front and top out, 0 from behind; the kit world 10/10, 0.
  **ON A ROOF THE LENS PULLS OUT** -- above `highY` (3.4 m), not inside, grounded or in cover or on a
  ledge: the boom x`highK` 1.45 and `highEl` .14 rad more tilt, eased both ways; in cover up there
  x1.7 so he can peer over. A manual zoom key is his "eventually" and is not built.
  **THE SHADER COULD NOT BE COMPILED HERE** (no GPU, no GLSL compiler); the shipped `kitCutMat` was
  run on three's own standard shader and the spliced text read -- every anchor lands, and the Bayer
  function yields the 16 distinct thresholds of the standard tile. It uses int `^`/`&`/`>>`, which
  is GLSL ES 3.00 and what three r180 compiles for.

- **THE KIT CITY: HIS SIXTY KIT BUILDINGS ON THE OLD LOTS, INTACT UNTIL HIT (m180, `KCITY`,
  `buildKCityCol`, `kitObb`, `kitTwinIndex`, `kitSwap`, `kitInst`, `kitPrune`, `npm run twins`).**
  *"All 60 old generated buildings are replaced, one per lot, facing the street... Intact walls
  use the plain, cheap wall pieces. Each wall knows its chunked twin. On the first hit, the game
  swaps that one wall for its chunked version... Draw calls: this is the big risk."*
  **A FIFTH WORLD (`tkit`), NOT A REPLACEMENT**, because he asked to compare: `toon` still loads the
  old set. Both run the same code; `kitWorld()` / `inTK()` say which parts apply.
  **READ OFF THE FILES FIRST, and two things were not what the note implied:**
      collision   7,679 objects and **NO EXTRAS AT ALL** -- the `piece_id` his note says each kit
                  collider carries is only in the NAME: `bld_kit_000_wallB_window__L0_W0_0_w_3` is
                  wall `kit_000/L0_W0_0_w`, box 3 (`KCITY.kitRe`). Every kit collider is an
                  8-corner box baked to world space and turned with its building.
      buildings   roots at ANY yaw (-173 to +178 degrees), which the m179 cell test, the ladder
                  and the cutaway all assumed was zero.
  **THE COLLIDERS ARE FITTED, NOT GUESSED (`kitObb`)**: the bottom four corners are a rectangle and
  two edges off one corner are its axes. 6,276 fitted, worst corner outside its own box 0.13 mm.
  **A KIT BOX IS NOT IN `SURF`**: the swap takes a wall's boxes away, and a triangle in the static
  surface grid cannot be taken away -- so the box is the surface a bolt stops on, which is exact.
  **THE TWIN'S CHUNK TABLE IS READ AT LOAD, NOT AT THE SWAP.** Chunk ids are the same on the wall and
  its twin, so the ivy (24,976 verts), dressing (10,992) and all 126 AC units are wired to chunks
  that do not exist in the geometry yet, and nothing is re-linked when it swaps. Measured: all
  17,612 twin chunk centres sit on their own wall's static collider, worst 0.000 m.
  **THE SWAP IS HIS FIVE STEPS**: the intact range of the batch collapses, the twin is spawned at the
  wall's world transform in the BUILDINGS' materials (by name -- the library's textures are never
  drawn), its static boxes go, its chunk boxes come in, and `kitKill`/`kitFlood` take it from there.
  It fires from `kitBlast` (and from `kitKill`, so nothing can kill an intact chunk directly).
  **DRAW CALLS 12,233 -> 88.** The static pieces, the walls (with ranges), the glass (with ranges)
  AND NOW THE IVY AND DRESSING merge by material; the 322 moving parts (doors, leaves, lids, ACs)
  become 64 InstancedMeshes (`kitInst`) with each node kept, drawing nothing, and `kitInstSync`
  copying its matrix when it moves. The double-door cut is cached per source geometry, or twenty
  wide doors would be forty unique leaves that cannot share an instance. Then `kitPrune` drops
  19,814 nodes the game never reads (2,930 of them markers) -- 1,188 left under the world.
  **THE PIECE LIBRARY IS 5.7 MB AND THE GAME NEEDS 0.94 OF IT (`npm run twins`).** Its textures are
  never drawn (twins wear the buildings' materials), so the tool copies the 42 `wallB_*` twins out,
  every bufferView byte-identical (747/747), no images. **Re-run after every library export.**
  **A GRID REBUILD IS NOW A MILLISECOND** (7,449 boxes), so it had to stop happening per event:
  a door is filed in the grid under its whole swing (`gpad`) and never rebuilds it, and a blast or a
  fall rebuilds ONCE however many chunks it kills (`kitHold`/`kitRegrid`). A kill used to rebuild
  per chunk. And `kitStep` walks only the walls that can break (`kit.live`), `kitBlast` asks each
  wall a sphere question first, and `kitFlood` runs per wall hit -- m170 flooded every wall after
  the first one hit, harmless on twenty and 1,344 flood fills a bolt here.
  **TURNED, EVERYWHERE THE KIT READS POSITION**: `kitCell` works in the root's own frame, `KCLIMB`
  entries carry their own along/out axes, and the cutaway box is in the building's frame (the shader
  AND `camBlock`, and the shader applies `instanceMatrix` now that parts are instanced).
  **AND A LADDER WHOSE FOOT IS ABOVE HIM IS STEPPED ONTO** -- a city ladder stands on the pavement
  25 cm over the road, and `stepClimb`'s "off the bottom" test let go on the first frame. `kitSlot`
  also had to learn `kit_000` (it only knew `BKG0`, so every building paired as `:X0`).
  Driven through the shipped code on loader-shaped scenes (`tkprobe.mjs`): 1,344 walls, 0 without a
  twin; walking at 12 intact walls stops him 0.37 m out on every one; breaking a solid wall out lets
  him through; the swap takes 4.7 ms; **all 120 ladders latch and top out on their markers**; the
  cut box is right in a building turned 91 degrees; a door swings its instance. The old kit world
  re-measured unchanged except 84 -> 76 draws. **The visual file is draco and was not driven here**
  -- it is the old city's pipeline on the old city's structure.









- **THE LEDGE AND COVER ARE FOR THE OUTSIDE OF A BUILDING, A FLOOR IS A CEILING, AND THE FIRST
  INSIDE CAMERA (m179, `KBLD`, `kitLedgeOK`, `kitCoverOK`, `_ceilH`, `KCUT`, `kitCamStep`).**
  *"The ledge hang happens on a bunch of random stuff and the cover happens inside the building --
  you just get caught on stuff. Only on the roof and the outside sides for now. You can jump
  through the floor of the second story. And we need a smart camera for inside the building."*
  **THE BUILDINGS ARE KNOWN CELL BY CELL** from his roots' own extras (`cells` + `heights` on the
  generated ones, `footprint_bays` + `levels` on the house), mapped with the convention read off
  the collision file (BKG0's first floor tile at exactly x 0..3, z -17..-14 under a root at z -14).
  **INSIDE = in a cell AND below its roof**, so a roof is outside.
      COVER   only where he is not inside -- the street, or a roof against a parapet
      LEDGE   only a ROOF EDGE (the lip at or above the roof of the cell it belongs to, so a
              parapet counts) taken from off the building in plan -- or from a LOWER roof up to a
              taller one's edge, which is the setback. Sills, floor bands, chunk tops half way up
              a wall, stairs and railings are all refused.
  Tabled through the shipped predicates: parapet and bare roof edge from the street ALLOW, BKG3's
  tall edge from its low roof ALLOW; a sill at 4.0, a chunk top at 1.6, a parapet from the roof
  side and a railing indoors all refused; cover refused in a room, allowed in the street.
  `KIT.gate = 0` puts m89/m102 back. **Kit world only** -- the other worlds have no cells to ask.
  **A FLOOR ABOVE IS A CEILING.** `triAdd` keeps only up-facing faces, so the underside of a floor
  was nothing to a man rising through it -- m166's lesson ("a collider that rejects is not a file
  that lacks") one axis over. `SURF` has the undersides: the head's travel each sub-step is one
  vertical `surfRay`. Driven: a jump in a ground-floor room peaks with his head at 2.77 against an
  underside at 2.80; the same jump in the street still reaches 2.72 m. Stair holes have no
  triangle, so the stairs still go up.
  **THE INSIDE CAMERA IS A CUTAWAY, AND IT IS AN EXPERIMENT ON A SWITCH (the INSIDE chip: CUT /
  CLOSE / OFF).** CUT: one `discard` in every kit material -- inside the box of the building he is
  in and above `cutH` (1.45 m) of his storey, nothing is drawn, so the floors over him, the roof
  and the tops of the walls go; the lens lifts to `cutEl` .86 rad to look down into the room; and
  `camBlock` lets the boom pass through what is not drawn, or it would be dragged in against walls
  nobody can see. The uniforms are SHARED objects, so moving the cut never recompiles. CLOSE: no
  cut, a 2.3 m boom. **No see-through hole existed in melee to borrow** -- the `noHole` flags are
  set and nothing reads them.
  **NOT DONE: the shadow pass does not take the cut**, so the cut-away roof still shades the room.
- **HIS GENERATOR'S ROW IS IN, AND THE REAL WORK WAS DRAW CALLS (m178, `kitBatch`, `kitMerge`,
  `kitHang`, `kitSlot`, AC parts).** *"It made a row of four new buildings behind the test house...
  every awning, sign, ivy leaf and AC unit knows which wall chunk it's hanging on."*
  Read out of both files first:
      generated   4 roots BKG0..3 at z -14, 897 nodes: 138 chunked walls (`chunk_attr` "_CHUNK"),
                  84 panes, 9 hinged doors, 2 "rollup" panels (the double-door art again), 4 hatches,
                  12 AC units (`host` + `host_chunk`), 4 each of ivy / dressing / pipes
      collision   one file for all five buildings, same prefixes, 10 climb volumes with `climb_top`
      **1,405 DRAW PRIMITIVES in the generated file alone**, 552 of them walls, on top of the
      house's ~200. That was never going to run on a phone.
  **THE BATCH**: at load, per file, one merged mesh per material in world space. Static pieces
  (floors, roofs, corners, parapets, stairs, ladders, pipes) are merged outright; WALLS are merged
  keeping each wall's vertex and index RANGE, so a chunk kill collapses inside its own range and
  the debris is cut from its own index range; GLASS keeps a range per pane. Doors, leaves, hatches
  and ACs stay objects (they move or fall); ivy and dressing keep their own buffers (they collapse
  per chunk). **A source mesh is EMPTIED (`material = []`), never removed** -- a door is a child of
  its wall node and a lid of its hatch, and removing the parent would take the moving part with it.
  Measured through the shipped builders on both files: **draws 1,505 -> 84** (house 197 -> 21,
  row 1,308 -> 63). `KIT.batch = 0` is the A/B. The chip carries `DC<before>><after>`.
  **LADDERS PAIR BY BUILDING** (`kitSlot`): `X3` exists in BKG0, BKG1 and BKG3, so the house's bare
  `X#` pairing would have handed one building's ladder another's roof. `BKG0:X3` against `:X1` for
  the house; all ten volumes found their own marker.
  **IVY AND DRESSING ARE ONE SYSTEM** (`kitHang`), per primitive because a multi-primitive node is
  a Group. A leaf puffs; an awning or sign FALLS -- its own triangles lifted out (`kitDebrisVerts`)
  -- then both collapse. **AN AC UNIT IS A PART** with a box collider built off its own bounds; it is
  shootable (hp 30) and it falls when its host chunk goes. 12 of 12 hosted.
  **CHECKED OFFLINE WITH THE SCENE BUILT THE WAY GLTFLoader BUILDS IT** -- a Group of Meshes for a
  multi-primitive node, extras on `userData`, custom attributes lower-cased -- because m172 is what
  fabricating it the file's way costs. A kill on a batched wall collapses exactly its 4 vertices
  and throws the chunk plus the awning on it; a pane collapses 4/4; walking at the row from the
  street stops at every front and passes only through the three gaps between buildings.
  **THE SPAWN MOVED** to the street between the house and the row (24, -9.5), facing the row.
  **Re-baked** the generated file: 64 MB resident -> ~8, 372 non-image bufferViews byte-identical.
- **FIRING IN AUTO TURNED HIM 90 DEGREES OFF THE SHOT, AND IT WAS A HELD NUMBER NOBODY REFRESHED
  (m177, `aimComp`).** *"When I'm shooting my character points 90 degrees to the right instead of
  straight down the direction."* Driven first, so the guess was not the fix: through the shipped
  `stepKit`/`stepPlayer`, AUTO and CHARGE, standing and walking, **`faceH` sat on `cam.az` to 0.0
  degrees in every case** -- where he FACES was right, so the fault was in what is DRAWN on top.
  Read out of `zap.glb`: `shoot` holds the barrel 18 deg right of his nose with the chest bladed
  48 deg, and `aimComp` is the rigid yaw that turns him until the barrel lies down the shot --
  capped at 40 deg and, during `fireT > 0`, HELD at `compHold` so a single shot's follow-through
  does not swing. **AUTO arms and fires on the SAME frame and re-fires faster than the shot beat
  ends**, so `fireT` is never 0 for a whole burst and the hold held a value it had never written
  this commitment: whatever was left over, up to the cap either way. 40 the wrong way on top of a
  48-degree blade is the ninety he saw. AUTO now tracks the barrel live, and `compHold` is cleared
  whenever he is not committed, so a stale hold cannot reach the next burst either.
- **THE ROLL-UP SHUTTER IS DOUBLE DOORS, BECAUSE THE PICTURE ON IT IS (m177, `kitDoubleDoors`,
  `kitCutX`, `KIT.wide`, `KIT.doorOpen`).** *"The doors retract upward, and yet the image of the
  door is not that kind of a door... they should open like normal double doors."* His file marks
  the wide opening `door: "rollup"`; the region of `WK_M_doors` it samples (u .628-.874, v .669-.848)
  is -- cropped out of the atlas and LOOKED AT -- a pair of steel doors with push bars and a seam
  down the middle. The atlas does carry a real roll-up drawing elsewhere; this panel is not it.
  So the one panel is CUT AT THE SEAM into two leaves: every vertex past the cut is pulled onto it
  and its UV re-interpolated along its own edge (checked: both leaves 1.25 m, the UVs meeting at
  .751 exactly, the back faces mirrored), each leaf shifted so its outer edge is its hinge, and
  both run through the hinged door's own code with `flip` -1 on the right leaf so the pair opens
  as a pair. A collider box each, as a child, so `kitPartBox` needed no case.
  **WHETHER A DOOR OPENS AT ALL IS HIS CALL** -- *"maybe they don't open at all and you just have
  to shoot them"* -- so it is the `DOORS SWING / SHUT` chip on the FX key, shown only in the house.
  `KIT.wide = 'rollup'` puts m171's shutter back for the day one is drawn on it.
- **HIS SECOND HOUSE EXPORT: GLASS, PIPES AND IVY, AND ONLY THE IVY NEEDED CODE (m176, `kitIvy`,
  `kitIvyDrop`, `kitAttr`).** *"Glass windows, the pipe system and ivy are built into the test house
  and re-exported."* Read out of the file before anything was wired:
      walls      20, chunk data unchanged -- 6,264 / 6,264 chunk vertices still inside their box
      glass      10 panes, each a Group of TWO primitives (`BK_M_glass` + `BK_M_glint`, both
                 BLEND + double-sided) with its `col_` child -- so `kitPartAdd`, `kitPartBox` and
                 `kitPartKill` take them unchanged, and hiding the node takes the glints with it
      pipes      one mesh, `WK_M_rustmetal` + COLOR_0, extras `pipes: 4`. Decoration by his own
                 note, and it DOES NOT break: a chunk shot out from behind a pipe leaves the pipe
                 standing in the air. Tagging it the way the ivy is tagged would fix that.
      ivy        one mesh, 940 verts / 470 tris, `_HOST` + `_CHUNK` + a `hosts` list of 12 wall
                 `piece_id`s
  **THE IVY TAGS WERE CHECKED IN EACH WALL'S OWN FRAME**: every tag resolves to a real wall and
  chunk, 0 triangles straddle two tags, and 468 of 470 triangle centres sit on (or within a leaf's
  reach of) the chunk they name. **The two that do not are ONE card on `L1_S3_B0` tagged chunk 10,
  whose centre is 2.1 m from that chunk** -- reported to him rather than re-tagged here by position,
  because a second opinion on his data is how two systems start disagreeing.
  **`_HOST` IS LOWER-CASED BY THE LOADER EXACTLY AS `_CHUNK` WAS (m172)**, so both go through
  `kitAttr`. A dead chunk collapses its leaves to a point (the chunk's own degenerate-triangle
  trick) and throws a few green sparks. Probe, with the attributes spelt the way the loader spells
  them: 732 verts wired across 62 chunks; one kill takes exactly its 16 verts; killing every chunk
  takes 366 of 470 triangles, and the other 104 are his `-1` parapet and trim leaves.
  The chip carries `V<n>`: ivy vertices that found their chunk. **0 with ivy on screen is the tags
  not arriving**, which is m172 wearing a leaf.
  **Re-baked** (`npm run ktx ... etc1s`): 235 non-image bufferViews byte-identical, tags, `hosts`,
  glass and pipes all present in the `_ktx2` file.
- **THE DIAGONAL SLASH WAS THE IMPACT FLASH CUT IN HALF BY THE WALL, AND THE FLOATING GOO WAS A
  MARK THAT NEVER LAY ON THE WALL (m175, `flashSeen`, `boxRay`, `hitFace` -> `out.x/y/z`).**
  *"When you shoot a wall there's a big diagonal slash on it -- the light burst goes through half
  of the triangle."* and *"there's still this green goo floating on nothing."*
  **THE SLASH.** `boltHit`'s flash is three additive SPRITES up to `6.4 x size` across -- flat
  cards facing the lens -- set at the impact and depth-tested. Against a wall the depth test keeps
  the half of each card in front and discards the half behind, and the line where a card's plane
  crosses the wall's is a hard straight edge through the glow. It was never the wall's triangles.
  A glow has no surface to be behind, so the flash now draws over everything **when the lens can
  see the impact** -- `flashSeen` is one camera-to-impact segment against `SURF` and a 35 cm
  sample of the boxes, once per hit -- and keeps the depth test when something ELSE hides it.
  **THE GOO, THREE FAULTS IN THE BOX BRANCH:**
  1. **A box hit stamped the mark where the BALL was**, up to `boltR` (17 cm) off the face or sunk
     into it. So it floated from the start, and when the chunk died its centre was outside the
     `decalOff` pad and it stayed. `hitFace` now returns the CONTACT POINT on the face it picked.
  2. **A fast bolt arrives INSIDE a 25 cm wall** (a half-step is a third of a metre), and "the face
     it is least deep into" then picked the SIDE of the chunk it was in -- a face that only exists
     BETWEEN chunks, so the mark stood out of the wall on its edge. `boxRay` is a slab test of the
     bolt's own segment in each box's frame: the face it came in through, and where. It runs beside
     `surfRay` and the nearer wins, since his house has floors in one store and walls in the other.
  3. **`boltBox` took the FIRST box within reach**, which on a wall of touching chunks was often a
     neighbour's corner, so the normal leaned off the wall. It takes the nearest now.
  **AND `hitFace` NEVER TOOK ITS ORIENTED BRANCH.** It read `near.x/near.z`; `boxNear` writes
  `nx/nz/cx/cz`. And when the point was INSIDE, `boxNear` returned -1 and left the record holding
  the previous call's answer -- so the callers pass null there now.
  Checked with the scratch kit probe: a point 10 cm off the S0 face and one 5 cm inside it both
  land at z 0.000 facing +z (before: x 1.456, normal (0.40, 0.92) -- a chunk corner); segments
  enter the S0, S1 and S2 faces with the right normals and pass through the window opening.
- **THE FLAT CARDS IN THE WALL WERE A RUBBLE DECAL STAMPED IN MID-AIR (m174, `decalOff`).** *"The
  little debris cards -- they're laid with their faces pointing upward... these weird flat laying
  images just don't read correctly. They're like floating flat 2-D images where you shoot the
  building and it breaks and it leaves these in its trail."* m170's `kitKill` called
  `decalHit(c.x, c.y, c.z, 0, 1, 0, 'rubble', ...)` -- a floor mark, face UP, at the dead chunk's
  CENTRE, which is the middle of the wall. So every chunk that went left a horizontal card hanging
  in the hole at that chunk's height, which is the banding in his screenshot. **Gone**: the chunk's
  own triangles already fly out as real 3-D debris (`kitDebrisChunk`), and that IS the rubble.
  **AND THE SCORCHES HAD THE SAME FAULT ONE STEP LATER.** A bolt's mark lies flat on the chunk face
  it hit; when the chunk dies the card stays, hanging where the brick was. Every mark now keeps its
  centre (`decal.at`), and `decalOff(box)` puts out any whose centre is inside a dead chunk's box,
  tested in the box's own frame with `boxLocal`, so the kill and the collider agree about where the
  chunk was. A broken pane does the same.
  **A MARK IS A PICTURE OF A SURFACE**, so anything that removes a surface has to remove its marks.
  The breakables in the toon city do not do this yet.
- **JUMP IS A TAP ON EITHER STICK, AND THE WEAPONS ARE A WHEEL (m173, `kitPick`, `WEPROW`).**
  *"If you're charging a shot with the right stick you can't jump and shoot -- so tapping on the
  left stick also needs to make you jump, and to switch weapons we need the same thing we have on
  the right stick for the blaster modes, on the left stick."* The left tap is `player.jump = 1`,
  the same line as the right, so every consumer of the jump (the double and its flip, the wall
  and ledge exits, the ollie, the rail catch, the ladder hop) gets it for nothing. A tap cannot
  collide with steering: it needs `trav < tapMove` and `held < tapT`, which no hold ever is.
  **THE WEAPONS ARE ON THE LEFT STICK'S INNER RING, ONE SEGMENT PER SLOT**, built by the same
  `buildArcRow` the mode row uses (it takes a ring now: `G = { r0, r1, span }`, `MODES` by
  default, so the existing rows draw what they drew). HANDS / BLASTER / HAMMER / BOARD, from a
  `short` label on the slot. It lights `swapTo` mid-reach, so the segment answers the press on
  the same frame. **The pal row (ROAM/PACK, REVERT) moved OUT a ring**, because it only exists
  when Clancy or a disguise does and the weapons are always there.
  **PRESSING THE BOARD WHILE RIDING TAKES THE DECK INTO HIS HANDS**, which `cycleKit` deliberately
  skipped (a cycle meant for the hammer must not throw him off); a direct press is a deliberate
  ask. `cycleKit` survives for the desktop's right click and `mel.kit()`.
  Geometry on a 390 px portrait phone: weapon ring tips at x 4 and 184, 28 px clear of the mode
  row; outer ring tips at 15 and 173.
- **THE HOUSE HAD NO WALLS IN IT, AND IT WAS THE LOADER, NOT THE HOUSE (m172, `kitCh`).** *"I'm
  unable to shoot or destroy any of the outside of the building -- my bullets don't even touch the
  outside of the wall, it just goes through and hits the inside -- and I can walk through walls
  too."* One bug. His file says `_CHUNK`; **GLTFLoader LOWER-CASES every attribute name it does not
  recognise** (`ATTRIBUTES[name] || name.toLowerCase()`, three places in `vendor/GLTFLoader.js`),
  so the game was handed `_chunk` and asked for `_CHUNK`. `buildKit` found no chunked mesh on any
  wall, returned before pushing a box, and m170 and m171 both shipped a house that was a PICTURE:
  0 walls, 0 chunks, 28 boxes (his solids only). A bolt went through the outer wall and stopped on
  what was in the collider -- a floor, a corner post, inside.
  **EVERY OFFLINE CHECK PASSED, BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF THEM READ THE FILE**, which spells it his way.
  The 6,264-of-6,264 containment check, the flood check and the debris check were all correct and
  all irrelevant: the loader is a step none of them took. **A harness that fabricates a scene has
  to fabricate it the way the LOADER builds it, not the way the file stores it** -- the same shape
  as `normals.mjs` measuring the asset instead of the pipeline, one layer down.
  **AND `tri: 1` ON THE CHUNK BOXES WAS A SECOND, INDEPENDENT REASON NO BOLT WOULD HAVE LANDED.**
  `tri` tells `boltBox` "my real triangles are in `SURF`" -- true of his collision file's solids,
  false of the walls, which have no baked collider. Off now; the chunk box IS the wall's face.
  Measured with a scratch probe that boots the real module, fabricates both GLBs with the
  attribute spelt `_chunk`, and walks the shipped `stepPlayer` at every wall every 25 cm on both
  floors: shipped code 0 walls / 0 chunks; fixed, 261 chunks, stopped 0.24 m (his radius) off
  every face, and the only pass-throughs are the door, shutter and door openings -- which in the
  game carry their own part boxes. `boltBox` inside a chunk: false before, true after.
  **`npm run sim`'s renderer stub had no `extensions`**, so KTX2Loader.detectSupport threw at module
  scope and the harness could not boot at all since m158. Fixed the way `boot.mjs` already was.
- **THE KIT'S DOORS OPEN, ITS GLASS BREAKS, AND A WALL THROWS REAL PIECES OF ITSELF (m171,
  `KPARTS`, `kitPartStep`, `kitPartKill`, `KDEB`, `kitDebrisChunk`).** *"You said it's not built
  yet -- why isn't it built? What's not built?"* m170 indexed every moving part with its hp and
  hinge data and did nothing with it; this is that list, done.
  **m170 WAS ALSO DRAWING FOURTEEN GREY BOXES.** Every moving part carries a `col_*` child mesh
  as its collider -- the breakables GLB's convention -- and a mesh in the visual file is a mesh
  the renderer draws. The breakables pass filtered `col_brk_*`; the kit pass never did. They are
  read for their bounds now and hidden.
  **THE AXES WERE READ OUT OF THE FILE, NOT TRANSLATED FROM THE NOTE.** The note speaks Blender:
  a hinged door turns about its local Z. The exporter has already converted the node to Y-up,
  and the door's own bounds say so -- x 0..1.04, **y 0..2.16**, z +/-0.03 -- so it is
  `rotation.y`, hinged at local x = 0, face normal local +Z. The shutter hangs DOWN from its
  pivot (y -2.60..0), the lid lies flat off a hinge at z = 0, a pane is centred. **A note
  written in one axis convention about a file stored in another is one sign from a bug.**
  **NO BUTTON OPENS A DOOR.** Walk into it and it swings AWAY from you -- his -100..100 limits
  exist so it can go either way -- with the direction LATCHED while it is open, because
  re-deciding every frame flips it the moment you step through and slams it into your back.
  `Ry(a)(1,0,0) = (cos a, 0, -sin a)`, so a man on the +Z side wants +a: worked, not argued.
  **The collider swings with it**, rewritten in place in `BOXES` from the `col_*` child's world
  matrix, so the resolver pushes him out of the slab where the slab actually is.
  **THE SHUTTER SCALES TOWARD ITS TOP PIVOT RATHER THAN SLIDING.** Sliding by `travel` puts 2.6 m
  of shutter through the wall above the opening; scaling toward the top edge is a roll-up
  rolling up and cannot poke through anything.
  **THE HATCH OPENS FOR HIM FROM BELOW AND IS A LID FROM ABOVE.** One that opened for anyone
  near it would open under his feet on the roof. Shooting it (hp 60) makes it a hole. **Which
  way it lifts is `KIT.hatchSign`** -- reasoned, not measured, and stated as such.
  **`blowout: true` IS A DIRECTION.** The shards go the way the blow travelled, so a pane shot
  from outside showers the room.
  **THE DEBRIS IS THE WALL'S OWN TRIANGLES, LIFTED OUT BEFORE THE COLLAPSE** -- every primitive,
  every attribute, in the materials they were drawn in -- because the collapse is what destroys
  what it would copy. Checked over the real file: **all 261 chunks yield triangles, and 0 of
  3,638 triangles straddle two chunk ids**, so testing one vertex per triangle is exact. Capped
  at `debrisMax` (a piece is up to four draw calls), it lands on the REAL ground (`groundAt`, so
  a piece off the upper storey lands on the deck inside rather than falling to the street), and
  it shrinks out rather than fading, because a fade on an opaque mesh is a second material and
  a sort for something nobody is looking at.
  **A MULTI-PRIMITIVE NODE IS A GROUP OF MESHES AT IDENTITY; A SINGLE-PRIMITIVE NODE IS THE MESH
  ITSELF**, whose `matrix` is relative to the root and must not be applied again. All 20 walls
  here are multi-primitive (measured), so the guard is for the next export and not this one.
  **STILL NOT BUILT, AND SAID:** the `nav_*` / `room_*` / `repair` markers are loaded and nothing
  reads them -- they are for fire spread, firemen, repair crews and police, none of which exist
  yet -- and the kit world still loads no bodies.

- **THE BUILDING KIT IS A FOURTH WORLD, AND EVERY CLAIM IN HIS HANDOFF WAS CHECKED BEFORE A
  LINE WAS WRITTEN (m170, `KIT`, `buildKitCol`, `buildKit`, `kitBlast`, `CLIMB`).** *"I want
  buildings that are breakable, and also buildings you can go inside -- staircases that go up to
  the next floor, ladders you can climb -- but a big thing is I want to be able to destroy the
  building piece by piece."* He shipped three GLBs and a note; the note is the spec and it is
  accurate, which is worth saying because **a handoff read wrong is a build spent on a file that
  was always fine**:
      `_CHUNK`          confirmed, upper-cased exactly as he warned
      the axis rule     `(x, y, z) -> (x, z, -y)`: **100% of 1,044 chunk vertices land inside
                        their own converted box**, against 14% for the identity reading
      the transforms    every wall is a PURE +Y rotation at unit scale under one root that is
                        also pure Y at unit scale -- so a chunk collider is an ORIENTED box and
                        it is EXACT rather than a fit
      geometry sharing  **mesh 21 is used by TEN wall nodes and mesh 15 by seven**
      the walls         261 chunks, 194 anchored, 3.3 neighbours; FOUR primitives per wall
      no draco          which is the only reason any of the above could be read here
  **AND THE SIGN WAS DECIDED BY PRINTING A CHUNK, NOT BY A TOLERANCE.** My first pass reported
  `(x, z, -y)` AND `(x, z, +y)` both at 100%, which cannot both be true -- the reader was taking
  `primitives[0]` of a FOUR-primitive wall and seeing 36 vertices of a 396-vertex mesh. Printed,
  chunk 0's verts read z **-0.250..0.000** and `(x, z, +y)` gives 0.000..0.250, the other side of
  the wall. **A measurement that agrees with both answers is a measurement that has not run**,
  and this file's own rule (ask what a check would still pass with) caught it.
  **THE CHUNK COLLIDER IS PROVEN, NOT ASSUMED.** The one piece of new arithmetic here is the
  local box -> world oriented box, and getting it wrong is invisible walls or no walls at all.
  Lifted `kitBox` from the shipped file and ran the same centre/yaw/half-extent maths against
  every real vertex: **6,264 of 6,264 inside their own collider box, worst escape 0.0000 m.**
  **CLONE ON THE FIRST HIT OR A HOLE IS NINE HOLES.** His note says it and the file says how
  badly: ten wall nodes share one mesh. `kitClone` is per INSTANCE and lazy, because cloning all
  twenty up front is twenty buffers for a house most of which is never touched.
  **A DEAD CHUNK'S TRIANGLES COLLAPSE TO A POINT**, which is m145's trick surviving m147: every
  vertex carrying that id is written to the chunk's own LOCAL centre, each of its triangles
  becomes zero-area, and a degenerate triangle is discarded before rasterisation for free.
  **To the point the chunk IS AT, never the origin** -- a degenerate triangle still counts toward
  a bounding sphere, and collapsing to zero grows the wall's sphere to the middle of the world
  and turns its frustum culling off. And it is ordinary JavaScript on ordinary meshes, which is
  m147's whole finding: a mechanism that cannot be verified where it fails is the wrong one.
  **THE FLOOD FILL IS WHAT MAKES IT A BUILDING.** His step 4: flood from every ANCHORED chunk
  through `nb`, and anything the flood never reaches is a lump of wall with nothing under it.
  Staggered by `KIT.fall` so a hole SPREADS rather than a bay blinking off at once, and re-run
  after each fall because a chunk going can orphan the one above it.
  **`KIT.dmg` IS ONE NUMBER AND HIS hp IS UNTOUCHED.** `FOE.dmg.bolt` is 1.9 and a chunk is hp
  20, so without it a wall chunk is an eleven-shot object -- `BRK.dmg`'s own argument. The hp is
  HIS and a re-export must not lose it, so the scale is converted rather than the data rewritten.
  **THE LADDER IS A VOLUME AND IS NOT IN THE COLLIDER**, which is why `buildKitCol` tests
  `climb_` FIRST: it is a thing you latch to, not a wall you stop against, and a box in a
  doorway-sized gap is exactly what a ladder must not be.
  **UP AND DOWN COME FROM THE THUMB'S COMPONENT ALONG THE WALL, NEVER ITS RAW Y** -- the stick is
  in world space and the camera can be anywhere. **And which way is "into" is MEASURED at the
  latch**: a ladder volume is tall and thin, so its short horizontal axis is out of the wall, and
  which SIGN is out is simply where he was standing when he grabbed it. No extra field is asked
  of his export and it cannot be backwards on one ladder and right on the other.
  **TOPPING OUT GOES TO HIS `nav_ladder_top__X#`**, matched to the volume by the `X#` in the two
  names rather than by a nearest-point guess, with the volume's own top as a stated fallback.
  **AND THE KTX2 BAKE IS NOT ABOUT THE WIRE.** Ten 1024 maps are 1.7 MB in the GLB and **53 MB
  on the phone** as full RGBA with mips. ETC1S: **53 -> about 7**, 217 non-image bufferViews
  verified byte-identical. **Re-run it after every re-export** or the phone plays old textures
  on new geometry.
  **`models/building_kit` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- twelfth time.
  **WHAT IS NOT BUILT YET, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND:** the doors, the shutter and the
  roof hatch are indexed with their hp and their hinge data and **do not open**; the glass is
  indexed and does not break; there is no debris GEOMETRY (a chunk leaves dust, a rubble decal
  and a clang); the `nav_*`, `room_*` and `repair` markers are loaded and nothing reads them;
  and the kit world loads NO bodies at all, deliberately -- every `at` table in this file is a
  list of test-site coordinates and a body spawned inside a 9 x 6 m house is m24's lesson.

- **THE BARREL ROLL PIVOTED ON HIS CHEST BECAUSE THE NUMBER WAS MEASURED ON ANOTHER BODY
  (m169).** *"When he does the barrel roll he spins about his head when he should be spinning
  about his hips. Also you can't double jump on a skateboard whereas I kind of wish you could,
  and his jump is kind of small."* Three, and the first one is the interesting one.
  **m167 TYPED THE PIVOT AT .95, WHICH IS SHREDWORLD'S `TRICK.pivot` -- MEASURED ON COLIN.**
  Read straight out of `zap.glb`'s node hierarchy (the skeleton is plain glTF; draco only touches
  mesh primitives), at the x1.926 the game draws him at:
      LeftFoot 0.231   **Hips 0.772**   Spine 0.860   Spine2 1.039   Head 1.274
  **0.95 sits between his Spine and his Spine2 -- his chest.** A body turning about its chest has
  a head that moves 0.32 m and legs that sweep 0.77, and from a phone that is "spinning about his
  head" told exactly. The geometry was right, the axis was right, and the one typed number was a
  fact about a different rig. **A CONSTANT CARRIED OVER FROM ANOTHER GAME IS A MEASUREMENT OF
  ANOTHER BODY**, and this file had the bone sitting right there.
  So `rig.hipY` is measured in `buildRig` on the BIND pose, beside `faceOff` and `rig.bind` --
  the bind height rather than the live one, because the live hips bob with every clip and a pivot
  that bobs is a wobble welded into the roll -- and `SK8.trick.pivot` becomes a MULTIPLIER on it,
  1 being his hips exactly. A re-export at any proportions lands right with no edit, which is
  this repo's rule for every other measured thing and should have been the rule here.
  **THE OLLIE WAS THREE QUARTERS OF HIS ON-FOOT JUMP, WHICH IS BACKWARDS.** At `MOVE.g` 20:
      on foot  MOVE.jump 10.6  ->  2.81 m, 1.06 s
      ollie    was 9.2         ->  2.12 m, 0.92 s      <- a board leaving the ground SOFTER
      ollie    now 12.6        ->  3.97 m, 1.26 s      <- Shredworld's own, same gravity
  Shredworld writes 12.6 up as *"a big ollie: about 4 m"* and the gravity is identical, so it is
  a number that transfers -- unlike the pivot, which is a fact about a BODY rather than about the
  physics. **Which of the two a constant is, is the question to ask before copying one.**
  **AND THE SECOND TAP WAS ALREADY FREE.** In the air that pad's tap was the RAIL CATCH and
  nothing else, so a tap over nothing did nothing at all. The catch still outranks it, which
  costs no new rule: a tap over a rail is a grind and a tap over nothing is the double, decided
  by what is under him rather than by a mode. **The gate is `p.jumps > 0`**, so rolling off a
  kerb grants nothing -- the second jump exists only if he took the first, which is why the ollie
  marks `p.jumps = 1` at the moment the POP fires and not when it is armed.
  **SET, NOT ADDED (`SK8.second` .92).** Kicking off nothing is not a leg press; and adding to
  whatever he has sends a double off the top of an ollie into orbit and one off the bottom of a
  fall nowhere. Set, it is the same height whenever it is spent, which is what makes it a save.
  **AND IT FLIPS HIM AS IT LIFTS HIM**, with `bodyFlip` called BELOW the new velocity so the
  flip is fitted to the air he has after the kick rather than before it. `bodyFlip` became a
  function for that: two gestures start one now (the left pad's flick and this), and a second
  copy is a second thing to keep in step.

- **`stopAllAction()` PUTS A SKELETON IN THE T-POSE, AND m165's COMMENT SAID THE OPPOSITE
  (m168).** *"The current civilian goes into T-pose and stays there while a warrior alien starts
  off at the size of a pea and grows over it. They're both there at the same time. There's no
  proxy mesh, there's no morph... none of it works even close to anything like it's supposed to."*
  Three separate faults in one picture, and all three were mine.
  **THE T-POSE IS ONE LINE, READ STRAIGHT OUT OF THE VENDORED BUILD:**
      _deactivateAction(t){ ... 0 === --s.useCount && (s.restoreOriginalState(), ...) }
  `restoreOriginalState` writes back the value captured when the binding was MADE, which is the
  BIND POSE. So `stopAllAction()` -- the one line written to *"leave the skeleton exactly where
  the last update put it"* -- is the line that snapped it to a T. **A behaviour asserted only in
  a comment, for the sixth time in this file**, and this one was the thing on screen.
  **THE HONEST WAY TO FREEZE A SKELETON IS TO STOP UPDATING ITS MIXER**, which costs nothing.
  **AND THE OTHER TWO FAULTS ARE THE DESIGN, NOT A BUG IN IT.** m165 reasoned that two skins
  share no topology -- a hick and the warrior are different meshes with different vertex counts,
  which is TRUE -- and concluded that the only thing left was to put BOTH bodies on screen and
  cross-fade their scales. **The conclusion was wrong and the counter-example was already in this
  file.** `MORPH`'s proxy blob (m113) has interpolated between two bodies that share no topology
  since the DNA gun was built: what two bodies DO share is a SILHOUETTE -- a radius per height
  band per bearing, which every body has and which two bodies have the same NUMBER of -- and that
  is a real correspondence to morph across. **The thing he asked for existed and was wired to the
  other trigger.** *"We were making proxy mesh morphs using joint positions"* -- he was describing
  the machinery this repo already had, and m165 built a second, worse one beside it.
  **SO THE VIRUS TURN GETS THE SAME BLOB THE DNA GUN USES.** The old body is REMOVED, the shape
  travels from its measured silhouette to the new kind's, and the new body arrives INSIDE it at
  `VIRUS.at` (.48), hidden, and is unveiled at `VIRUS.show` (.72) as the shell opens.
  **At no point are there two of them**, which is the whole complaint. The husk, the grow and
  `stopAllAction` are gone together: they were three parts of one wrong shape.
  **THE PROFILE IS THE KIND'S, NOT A BODY'S, AND THAT IS FORCED.** The kind he is turning INTO
  does not exist on the frame the turn starts, so the silhouette has to come off `K.P.proto` --
  `kindProf` is a shim (`mphProf` wants `model.scale.x`, `faceOff` and a traversal; `K.P` has all
  three in pieces) and a cache. **Cached under `vProf`, not `prof`**: a KIND is not a SKIN, and
  sharing `mphProf`'s field would be two facts in one variable, which is the bug this build is
  undoing one scale down.
  **THE BLOB STOPPED BEING A SINGLETON.** `mphMake()` builds the geometry, material and scratch
  arrays into a RECORD; `MPH` is still the player's; `mphFill` takes a ninth argument defaulting
  to it. **That default is what keeps `npm run hull` green** -- it lifts the `PROF:` text and
  calls `mphFill` with eight arguments against an `MPH` it injects itself, so an instance
  parameter with a fallback is a new capability rather than a new thing for the harness to be out
  of step with. Re-run after the refactor: **all ok**, including *"and both ends are the bodies
  themselves"*, which is the assertion that says the interpolation really does travel.
  **`VIRUS.blobs` IS 3 AND PAST IT A TURN IS INSTANT, NOT QUEUED.** `mel.outbreak()` is thirty
  turns, and thirty shader materials compiled mid-frame is a visible hitch for an effect nobody
  can watch thirty of anyway.
  **AND `virusGo` RETURNS NOTHING ON THE BLOB PATH**, because the body arrives a beat later --
  so `mel.virus()` names the kind it is turning INTO rather than reporting `?`, which would read
  as a failure. `virusArrive` is the ONE place a new body is built, called by the midpoint and by
  the instant path alike; two descriptions of one man is two that drift apart on the first edit.
  **`faceOff` IS BAKED INTO BOTH PROFILES ALREADY** (that is what puts two different exports'
  silhouettes in one frame), so the blob is turned by his BEARING and nothing else -- taking it
  off per profile would be taking it off twice.
  **AND AN EMPTY PROFILE SAYS SO (`NO VPROF <kind>`).** Without it the turn falls silently back
  to the instant swap, which is *"there's no morph"* reported a THIRD time with nothing on screen
  to say whether the shape was skipped or was drawn and looked wrong. That is the one failure no
  harness here can reach: every character GLB is draco and **nothing in this container can build
  a skin**, so whether these particular prototypes yield a silhouette is a device question.
  `npm run hull` proves the measurement, the hole fill, the smoothing and the wrap turn a cloud
  of vertices into a body; it cannot prove that THESE clouds arrive.

- **THE BOARD IS SHREDWORLD'S NOW: A FOLLOW CAMERA, THE BARREL ROLL, AND THE BLASTER IN HIS
  HANDS WHILE HE RIDES (m167).** *"There are discrepancies between Shredworld and our version of
  the skateboarding mode... the camera doesn't do a follow cam when you're on the skateboard,
  whereas it should. When you're in the air after an ollie, a swipe left and a swipe right on the
  left stick do not do the barrel roll that they're supposed to. I want to make it so that I can
  still use my blaster when I'm riding and you can shoot and aim with the right stick just like
  Shredworld. When you're riding you need to be able to go a little bit faster... it's almost like
  a car, it's going -- you don't have to continue holding forward to go."* Four things, and only
  one of them was a number.
  **1. THE FOLLOW CAMERA IS BOARD-ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE.** A board goes where it
  POINTS, so the lens wants to be behind it and letting go of the pad should not leave you looking
  at its side. On foot it is the opposite -- he turns on the spot in any direction the left thumb
  picks, and a lens that swings in behind every one of those means the world spins whenever he
  does. Shredworld had to be told that twice (c105) and it is one condition here.
  **IT IS WRITTEN INSIDE `stepCam` BECAUSE `cam.az` HAS EXACTLY ONE WRITER** -- every other
  writer of that number lives there for the same reason, and an auto-follow anywhere else is the
  loop that never settles. Three things stand it down and each is a different reason: a DRAG is
  deliberate (`cam.idle` restarts), the AIM owns the bearing while the trigger is up (a follow
  would drag his shot off whatever he is pointing at), and the AIR makes a spin unreadable if the
  lens comes round with him.
  **2. THE BARREL ROLL IS GEOMETRY, AND THE FLICK WAS BAILING OUT.** `boardFlick`'s left-pad
  branch read `if (|up| < |dx|) return` -- "sideways on the left pad is steering", which is true
  on the GROUND and is nothing at all in the air. There is no clip, so the whole of him turns on
  `rig.root.rotation.z`, applied innermost on an XYZ root and therefore in his own frame -- the
  same channel the deck's bank uses, which is the proof it is the right one.
  **AND IT TURNS ABOUT HIS WAIST, NOT HIS FEET.** The root sits on the deck; about the origin his
  head would sweep a 1.7 m circle and he would ORBIT rather than roll. The offset is the pivot
  held still while the body comes round it -- Rz(a) on (0,-k,0) less where it started -- and it
  has to be added to the MAN AND THE DECK alike or the board stays behind while he goes round it.
  **ONE PLACE COMPUTES IT, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT RUNS FIRST.** `boardPose` is called before the
  root is placed, so the alternative is either two computations to keep in step or a frame-stale
  vector -- and at a full turn in under a second, a frame is visibly a board lagging its rider.
  `_roll` is zeroed ABOVE every early return in that function, or a frame that leaves early
  strands the body displaced off a roll that has ended.
  **A ROLL OWNS THE AIR WHILE IT RUNS.** The thumb that fired it is still on the edge of the pad,
  so without `p.barrel` gating the air spin he yaws through his own roll -- two rotations at once,
  which reads as neither. (Shredworld's `TRICK.rollLock`, learnt the same way.)
  **WHICH WAY A FLICK ROLLS HIM IS A DIAL (`rollSide`), NOT AN ARGUMENT.** +X is his left, so a
  positive `rotation.z` drops his right side, which makes a flick RIGHT a roll to the right. That
  is REASONED and **this file gets handedness backwards about half the time when it reasons** --
  and no harness here can build a skin, so it cannot be settled offline. One number to move.
  **3. RIDING AND SHOOTING: THE DECK AND THE WEAPON WERE ONE VARIABLE.** `boardOut()` required
  `slotNow().board`, so taking the blaster took the deck away -- which is Shredworld's own c84
  `KIT.on` bug (*one variable, two facts*) with the fields renamed. The deck IN HIS HAND is still
  a slot, because that really is what he is carrying; the deck UNDER HIS FEET is `p.riding` and
  nothing else, and `applySlot` now only clears it when the slot being taken IS the board.
      mount     `applySlot(lastWeapon())` DIRECTLY, never `swapGo` -- the reach sets `p.swap`,
                which would refuse the mount that caused it. His hands are busy anyway.
      step off  `boardDrop()`: remember the weapon, put the deck back in his hands
      knocked   the SAME `boardDrop()`, which it never used to need -- before m167 the deck WAS
                the slot, so putting it back was automatic. Without it a car hit leaves him with
                a blaster and no board anywhere, which reads exactly like the board being gone.
      the tap   skips the board slot while he is ON it, or a tap meant for the hammer dismounts
  **AND A SWAP NO LONGER DROPS HIM OFF THE DECK.** It had to while they were one slot: reaching
  into the bag WAS putting the board away. `boardMount` keeps its own `p.swap` test, because a
  hand in a bag is not also stepping onto a board -- a different question, so a different test.
  **THE POSE IS AN OVERRIDE, NOT A BLEND, WHICH IS c115'S WHOLE LESSON.** Laying a gun pose ON TOP
  of a push cycle gives the arms the push's swing PLUS the pose -- **averaging two clips that both
  key an arm does not give one arm doing both things, it gives a shrug** (m19 paid a build for
  that). So every board clip gains a `__legs` half and the gun pose keeps spine-up: every bone
  claimed exactly once, and they COMPOSE. The two at full weight summing to 2 is correct here and
  only here, because they are DISJOINT.
  **`aimIdle` HAD TO JOIN `SPLIT.up` AS WELL AS `SPLIT.legs`.** Its legs half is what the ordinary
  armed gait stands on; its UPPER half is the gun CARRIED AT REST, which is what a man riding with
  a blaster is doing most of the time. Without it the only upper pose is `aimPose` -- the SIGHTED
  hold -- and he rides the whole city down the barrel.
  **THREE THINGS IN THAT BRANCH WOULD HAVE BEEN QUIET BUGS:** a BODY FLIP must not be halved (a
  somersault with the arms held still), the push clip's `setScale` and its once-a-cycle seek have
  to go on the half that is actually PLAYING (Shredworld's c177, one clone along), and the
  "nothing resolved" fallback must NOT count the gun pose -- it is spine-up only, so a table
  carrying it and nothing else is still a pair of legs at BIND, which is the case the guard is for.
  **THE STATED GAP IS THE BARREL.** `stepSkate` owns the heading (the wheels are what steer), so
  he faces down the board while the reticle can be anywhere -- the shot goes where the reticle is,
  because `fireBolt` has always taken `cam.az`, but the GUN visibly disagrees. Shredworld answered
  that with a spine twist at c126; **melee deleted its spine-twist mechanism after three attempts
  each of which made it worse** (see the `aimComp` note), and it is not going back in. This is
  Shredworld's own c113 state, which is where that repo sat for thirteen builds.
  **4. AND THE SPEED WAS TWO NUMBERS.** The coasting half was already true -- `stepSkate` calls
  `integrate` with `ctl = 0`, so nothing in there scrubs a board and `SK8.roll` is the only drag
  it has. What moved is the ceiling and the drag: `top` 13 -> 19 (a sprint on foot is 7.2, so the
  board is plainly the fastest thing here) and `roll` .11 -> .065, a 6.3 s half life to 10.7 --
  let go at 19 and he is still doing 16.4 three seconds later, which is "it's just going".
  **`pushV` RIDES `(1 - sp/top)`**, so raising the ceiling tapers the last stretch rather than
  making the first one harsher, which is why only those two had to move.

- **THE MARK FLOATED BECAUSE THE WALL WAS IN NO COLLIDER AT ALL (m166, `SURF`, `surfRay`,
  `boltBox`, `hitFit`).** *"When I shoot like a building it puts the little blast mark on there,
  it's floating, like floating just off away from the building... some like small objects get the
  blast mark and the blast mark is bigger than the object. I'm still wondering how the other
  context window says just use the triangles for collide so I'm confused why we're not doing
  that, because the box colliders are horrid. They're absolutely horrible."*
  **HE IS RIGHT, AND HE HAD BEEN RIGHT THREE TIMES RUNNING.** m159 answered the first two by
  feeding every `bld_`/`prop_`/`solid_` mesh through `triAdd` and writing that up as *"the whole
  of the walkable fix"* -- and `triAdd` REJECTS a steep face by construction, which is the entire
  point of it. Counted on his own collision file, before a line was written:
      total triangles        37,702
      kept by `triAdd` (UP)  10,994   <- decks, kerb tops, dumpster lids
      thrown away            26,693   <- **every WALL in the city, in no collider at all**
  So the one surface a bolt actually hits was the one surface nothing had, and the impact point
  and normal came from `hitFace` off a BOX. **Measured, old path against new, same shot, the
  shipped `surfRay` against the shipped `tcObbBoxes` arithmetic:**
      west face   box died 13.71,61.10   triangle 13.73,61.10   mark was 0.02 m out
      south face                                                            0.14
      north face                                                            0.34
      diagonal                                                              0.22

  Up to half a metre of air on a RECTANGULAR building, which is his screenshot exactly, and the
  error grows with every angle and curve the box does not follow.
  **SO THE TRIANGLES GO IN A SECOND TIME, ALL OF THEM, AND IT IS A RAY TEST RATHER THAN A
  HEIGHTFIELD.** `TRI` answers "how high is the ground here", which has one answer per (x, z) and
  is exactly why it can only hold floors -- **a wall has no height**. `SURF` answers "what does
  this segment hit", which a wall can answer. Two questions, two stores: merging them would put
  every wall into `triGround` and each one would read as ground you can stand on.
  **AND `boltBox` IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS.** A box carrying `tri` wraps an object whose
  real shape is now in `SURF`, and the bolt skips it -- because without that the ray would place
  a perfect mark on the brick and the box a metre in front of the brick would kill the NEXT shot
  in clear air. Same floating hit, one frame later, **which is worse than not fixing it because
  it would look fixed half the time.** What still hits on a box is everything we have no
  triangles for: the 179 breakables (their colliders come from the breakables library, not the
  collision file), the test site's ten boxes, the cars.
  **COVERAGE WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, because it is the one way this goes backwards.**
  Every box the bolt now skips must have real triangles inside it or the shot flies through
  something it used to stop against: **bld 71/71, prop 231/231, solid 142/142 -- 0 empty.**
  **AND THE MARK IS BOUNDED BY WHAT IT LANDED ON (`hitFit`).** A scorch is sized by the CHARGE,
  which is right on a wall and absurd on a hydrant. The narrowest half-extent of the smallest
  collider box containing the impact caps it, `fitK` wide with a `fitMin` floor -- nothing typed
  per object, it is the same box the shot was already tested against asked a different question:
      bld    71 boxes  min half 2.19 m  ->  cap 4.8 m at worst, so a wall mark is NEVER capped
      prop  231         median 0.29     ->  0.64 m
      solid 142         median 0.07     ->  the 0.30 m floor, on a 14 cm post
  **0 IS "NO BOX HERE", AND IT IS NOT A SMALL OBJECT.** The road, a deck and open terrain all
  return 0 and must not be capped, which is why the test is `fit > 0` and not `fit < something`.
  **THE HIT POINT AND THE BALL ARE TWO DIFFERENT PLACES.** `b.pos` is pulled back off the surface
  by `WEAP.boltR` so the flash is not half inside the wall; `b.hitAt` is where the ray actually
  crossed the triangle. Stamping the decal at `b.pos` would float it by exactly the ball's radius
  -- **the bug this build is about, reintroduced by its own fix** -- so the mark takes `hitAt`.
  **AND THE NORMAL FACES THE WAY THE SHOT CAME FROM, NEVER THE WINDING.** These shells are
  closed, so half of every building is wound away from you; a mark laid along the triangle's own
  outward normal is on the far side of the wall and reads exactly like the decal not working.
  **WALKING IS STILL BOXES AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN QUIETLY LEFT OUT.** A segment test says
  what a bolt hit; it does not push a body out of a wall, and swapping `resolveBoxes` for a
  triangle sweep is a whole build with the locomotion on the other end of it. What moved here is
  every IMPACT -- and an impact is the one place a box's error is VISIBLE, because it leaves a
  mark on screen that says how far out the box was.
  **THE COST, MEASURED:** 37,702 triangles = 1.36 MB of Float32, a 24 ms build at load, a 25x24
  grid at 8 m, and **3.2 us per half-step ray** (5,000 in 16 ms) -- so twenty bolts in flight is
  0.13 ms a frame. Verified against his real collision file through the lifted `SURF:` text:
  west/south faces hit with normals (-1.00, 0, 0) and (0, 0, -1.00), straight down onto the road
  at y 0.000 with n +1.00.
  **AND THE CELLS COME FROM THE SEGMENT'S XZ BOX, NOT A DDA.** A half-step is 0.37 m against an
  8 m cell, so it is one cell and occasionally four; a DDA is more code to get wrong for a saving
  that does not exist at this length.

- **179 BREAKABLES IN A CITY OF 1,382 OBJECTS IS NOT FINDABLE, AND A COUNT IS NOT A DIRECTION
  (m166).** *"I'm unable to find anything that's breakable like objects in the scene... what's
  breakable, I can't find any breakable objects."* They were all there and all working; the chip
  said `BRK179/179` and every one of them looks like the prop standing next to it. **A DISTANCE
  is a thing you can walk down**, so the chip carries the nearest one's, and `mel.brk()` puts him
  beside it. If it stands him at a dumpster then FINDING them was the problem and the feature
  works; if it says there are none here, he is in the wrong world -- **and the two have to say
  different things or the report comes back the same shape next build.** `city.bar()`'s rule.
  **AND NO `BRK` TOKEN AT ALL MEANS THIS WORLD HAS NONE**, which is the other half of his
  sentence: they are the toon city's, and from the test site "there are none here" and "they are
  broken" were one picture.

- **I SLOWED DOWN THE WRONG TRANSFORM, AND THE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME SYSTEM (m165).** *"I don't
  know how you interpreted what I said as thinking it had to do with the transform from zap to a
  civilian -- that's not what I was talking about. The thing I was talking about is the transform
  between the civilians and the warrior alien."* There are **two** transforms in this game and
  they share no code:
      `MORPH` / `stepMorph`   the DNA gun. ZAP becomes a civilian. A MODEL SWAP on the player.
      `VIRUS` / `virusGo`     the virus gun. A civilian becomes the warrior. A RESPAWN of a BODY.
  m164 put `dur` and the silhouette morph on the first one, which he had not complained about,
  and left the second -- the one he has now asked about twice -- untouched. **Both are reverted:
  `MORPH.dur` back to 0.90 and `MORPH.shape` to 0.** The machinery stays wired because it is the
  same method the virus transform will eventually want, and because `mel.MORPH.shape = 1` is what
  produced the verdict below.
  **AND HIS VERDICT ON THE SHAPE MORPH IS THE ANSWER TO m163's QUESTION.** *"It's like taller and
  skinny now, it's weird -- it just looks way worse."* That is the transfer's measured 11-34%
  error seen at full strength on a body you are looking straight at. **At this quality the answer
  to "do I need to do the sculpts" is yes**, and it took putting it on screen to find that out --
  which is what the silhouette metric could not settle and never claimed to.

- **THE VIRUS TURN WAS A RESPAWN, WHICH IS INSTANT BY CONSTRUCTION (m165, `HUSKS`, `huskStep`).**
  *"It still happens so quickly you can't see any transform at all, it's just a blink of an
  eye."* `virusGo` called `bodyGone` and `bodySpawn` on the same frame, so there was never a
  moment with anything IN it -- the sparks, the flash and the chest thump were decoration on a
  cut. A duration alone would not have helped: there was nothing to spend it on.
  **AND THERE IS NO VERTEX MORPH AVAILABLE HERE, WHICH IS WORTH BEING CLEAR ABOUT.** A hick and
  the warrior are different meshes with different vertex counts; m163's deltas are all on ZAP's
  topology and can only ever deform HIS mesh. Nothing about that changes for these two bodies
  without the resculpt.
  **SO BOTH BODIES ARE ON SCREEN FOR THE TRANSITION, WHICH IS WHAT HE DESCRIBED ANYWAY.** *"It's
  almost like the monster alien is coming out of the last skin."* The old body stays as a HUSK,
  swelling and whitening, while the new one grows out of it and collapses the shell in the last
  `huskGo` of the beat. A skin that starts shrinking immediately reads as the body deflating
  rather than as something emerging from it.
  **THE HUSK IS THE OLD ROOT ITSELF, NOT A CLONE, AND THAT IS WHY IT HOLDS THE RIGHT POSE.**
  `mixer.stopAllAction()` leaves the skeleton exactly where the last update put it -- nothing
  rewrites those bones afterwards -- so the shell freezes standing the way he was standing. A
  `skeletonClone` with no mixer would be a T-pose, which is the m41 lesson about bind poses
  pointed at a corpse.
  **AND `bodyGone` KEEPS ITS MATERIALS ALIVE FOR IT.** They are cloned per body (m39: flashing
  one man must not flash all three) so the husk can whiten without touching anybody else -- but
  it means the dispose moves to the end of the husk's life rather than being skipped.
  **THE NEW BODY'S GROW IS A SHARE OF ITS OWN MEASURED SCALE**, so a re-export at any size still
  arrives at the right thing. Eased out, because a body that grows linearly reads as a model
  being scaled -- which is what it is.
  **STATED GAP: THE COLLIDER DOES NOT GROW WITH HIM.** `d.K.r` is the kind's radius and a
  30%-size warrior has a full-size one for about a second. Arguable either way -- he IS there --
  and it is written down rather than quietly fixed.
  `mel.VIRUS.dur` is the knob and **0 is m162's instant respawn exactly**, husk and all skipped.

- **THE SILHOUETTE ACTUALLY MOVES NOW, AND THE OLD TRANSFORM HAD NOTHING TO SLOW DOWN (m164,
  `SHAPE`, `shapeSet`, `MORPH.dur`).** *"It works surprisingly well, but that's partially because
  the transform happens in like a few frames -- it's so so so fast. The reason I even wanted to
  morph was so you could play it slower and there'd be a visual of the silhouette morphing. Since
  it's so fast it was just the snap of some fingers."*
  **`mphWear` SWAPS THE WHOLE MODEL**, so the mesh before the white flash and the mesh after it
  are two different objects -- the flash exists to hide a CUT. Stretching that over three seconds
  would only have made the cut easier to see, which is why "just add a slider" was not the whole
  job. What makes a silhouette move is one mesh whose vertices go somewhere, and that is exactly
  what `npm run morph` (m163) produced: every character's shape as a per-vertex delta on ZAP'S
  topology, which is the only topology they can share.
  **SO IT IS ALWAYS ZAP'S MESH, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** Going out, his body deforms into the target
  across the whole `out` phase and the swap at the peak is between two shapes that already match.
  Coming back, the mesh on screen IS his, so `back` runs the same morph in reverse and he emerges
  FROM the shape he was wearing. A hick's mesh has no targets and never needs any -- and
  `shapeSet` refuses unless the drawn skin is `rig.base`, so there is no state where it could
  apply deltas to somebody else's vertices.
  **THE THREE PHASES BECAME SHARES OF ONE DURATION.** `out`/`hold`/`back` were absolute seconds,
  which is precisely why the transform could not be tuned: three numbers that have to keep their
  ratio is a rhythm nobody can drag. Normalised, `MORPH.dur` stretches all three together --
  **0.90 s is byte-for-byte the beat m112 shipped** and 2.4 is the new default.
  **`updateMorphTargets()` IS WHAT BUILDS THE INFLUENCE ARRAY.** Without it
  `morphTargetInfluences` is undefined and every write is a silent no-op on an object that looks
  perfectly fine. And `morphTargetsRelative = true`, because these are deltas and not positions.
  **THE VERTEX COUNT IS CHECKED AND A MISMATCH REFUSES TO DRAW.** The deltas are indexed by
  zap's DRACO-DECODED vertex order -- the game decodes the same buffer with the same decoder, so
  they agree by construction -- but a re-export that changed the count would apply them to the
  wrong vertices, which is a character turning inside out three days after the cause.
  **AND `mel.shape('hick_skinny', .6)` HOLDS HIM THERE**, which is the only way to look at the
  shape itself rather than at a transform going past.

- **`bump.mjs`'s `EXT` DID NOT INCLUDE `.json` OR `.bin`, AND THAT HAD BEEN A SILENT STALENESS
  BUG FOR TWO BUILDS (m164).** `DIRS` is the tax everybody remembers and this is the one
  underneath it: the folder can be listed and the file still never hashed.
      m159   `toon_city_obb.json`     491 collider boxes, through `A()`, never hashed
      m160   `impact_marks.json`      16 decal rects, through `A()`, never hashed
  **A re-export of either would have kept the old one on his phone for ever**, with nothing on
  screen to say why -- which is the exact failure the whole hash mechanism exists to prevent,
  reintroduced by the filter rather than by the folder list.
  **IT SURFACED ONLY BECAUSE A BUMP SAID "none changed" ON A FILE THAT HAD JUST BEEN WRITTEN.**
  86 hashed before and 86 after, on a run where `shapes.bin` was new. That line is worth reading
  every time: a count that does not move when a file did is the tell. Fixed, and the same bump
  caught four more that had been stale by construction -- two Portland manifests included.

- **EVERYBODY GOES BOTH WAYS, AND THE CHEST THUMP (m163, `VIRUS.aliens`, `isAlien`, `civKinds`).**
  *"The warriors can't actually turn into civilians -- it's only the civilians that can turn into
  warriors and then back. I think they should kind of just go for everyone."* m162 gated the cure
  on `d.wasK`, which made a BORN warrior permanent -- and his reason is the one that matters:
  *"it's not just gonna be a gun that transforms them, it's gonna be something else, otherwise
  there'd be no point of shooting them."* The gun is a DEBUG trigger, and a rule that only works
  on bodies the trigger itself created is a rule that only exists in debug.
  **`wasK` STOPS BEING A GATE AND BECOMES A MEMORY.** Shoot the hick you infected and you get the
  hick back; shoot a born warrior and you get a civilian picked out of the roster. One line, and
  the specific case still beats the general one.
  **BUT THE KNOCK-DOWN REVERT STAYED NARROW, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.** Opening the cure to
  every warrior is right for a trigger you AIM and wrong for one that fires on its own: with
  `virusBack` alone, every born warrior beaten down three times becomes a random civilian and the
  street fills with them unattended -- which is the same argument that keeps CARS out of
  `brkBlast`. His own sentence is the narrower one: *"he shrinks back into THE normal civilian
  character."* `VIRUS.downsAny` opens it if that turns out to be the game.
  **A POOL RATHER THAN `FOE`, BECAUSE HE HAS ALREADY SAID THERE WILL BE MORE.** *"I'm also gonna
  have different versions of warriors so they're not all the same, but it's fine for now."* So
  `VIRUS.aliens` is a list, `isAlien(K)` asks the list, and a second warrior is one entry rather
  than a grep for `=== FOE`.
  **AND `KINDS` IS ONE ROSTER NOW.** `[FOE, HICK, HOBO, SKATER, BIKER, CIVIL, CLANCY, ...CIVILS]`
  was written inline for the `STUCK` defaults and the outbreak needs the same set. Two copies of a
  roster is this repo's oldest mistake wearing its smallest hat -- `npm run wear` kept its own
  `FILES` map and measured four characters while saying nothing at all about the fifth.
  **THE CHEST THUMP IS NAMED, NOT ROLLED.** *"When the civilian transforms into a warrior I want
  the thing where he stretches and beats his chest -- somebody breaking out of the skin."* The
  get-up rolls one of his two taunts at random, which is right for standing up off the floor and
  wrong here: `standing_taunt_battlecry` is not the beat he described. `VIRUS.taunt` names
  `standing_taunt_chest_thump` and falls back to the kind's own pool if a re-export renames it,
  so a missing clip is a quiet transform rather than a body stuck in a state whose clip has no
  weight. Entering the state is four fields and no new code -- it plays its clip, fires that
  clip's own sound beats in order and hands back to `idle` on its own.
  **AND ONLY THE ALIEN TAUNTS.** A civilian coming back out of one has nothing to crow about.

- **HOW CLOSE A SHAPE TRANSFER GETS WITHOUT A RESCULPT: HUMANS ~11-15%, THE WARRIOR 34% (m163,
  `npm run morph`).** *"I just wanna see how close we can get without me doing the sculpts, so
  that I know whether I need to go that route -- cause that's gonna be days or weeks of work."*
  **THE BASE IS ZAP'S OWN MESH, NOT A PROXY, AND THE CAPSULE IDEA WAS A DETOUR.** What the game
  needs is one TOPOLOGY carrying every character, because a glTF morph target is a per-vertex
  delta and deltas only exist between meshes that share a vertex ordering. Zap already has 13,704
  vertices in the right shape, so he IS the base. A capsule rig would have been a second thing to
  wrap onto that anyway.
  **THE SKIN WEIGHTS ARE WHY THE CORRESPONDENCE WORKS.** Every vertex carries JOINTS_0, so a zap
  vertex on the left forearm is matched only against target vertices on the left forearm, in that
  bone's own frame. A plain nearest-point in world space snaps an armpit onto the ribs and an
  inner thigh onto the other leg; this cannot, by construction. **57 of zap's 62 bones are shared
  with the hick** and the differences are thumbs, weapon mounts and a cigarette.
  **MEASURED AGAINST THE TARGET'S OWN SILHOUETTE, on the six columns that are trustworthy** --
  height, head width, and the four limb radii. `chest`/`hip`/`shoulder` are horizontal BANDS and
  these are T-pose meshes, so those three catch the arms and mean nothing:
      hick     11%      clancy  13%      hobo  15%      girl  19%      WARRIOR  34%
      misses      hick 0, hobo 0, warrior 280, clancy 1064, girl 1531 vertices
  A missed vertex does not move AT ALL, so zap's fingers stay zap's fingers on Clancy (27 joints,
  no finger bones) and on the girl (135 of her 193 are hair and tail).
  **AND THE WARRIOR IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS AND THE ONE THAT FAILS.** He is a different species
  mass -- thigh 0.100 against zap's 0.061, arm 0.099 against 0.050 -- and every limb comes out
  about half the thickness it should be. He is also exactly who the outbreak turns people into.
  **TWO THINGS WERE FOUND BY MEASURING RATHER THAN LOOKING, AND ONE WOULD HAVE SHIPPED:**
  1. **MY 4x4 INVERSE WAS COLUMN-MAJOR IN A ROW-MAJOR FILE**, and the failure mode is the
     instructive part: the 3x3 came back EXACTLY right and only the translation column was
     wrong, so bones near their own frame origin (the thighs, 10% error) transferred perfectly
     while the arms came out **seventeen thousand metres** off. A wrong matrix that is right for
     a third of the data is worse than one that is wrong everywhere, because the output still
     looks arguable. `M * inv(M)` against the identity is a two-minute test and it is now in the
     tool's own comment as the thing to run first.
  2. **AVERAGING K POSITIONS SHRINKS A CONVEX SURFACE** -- Jensen's inequality -- so every single
     measurement on all five characters came back SMALLER than its target. That is a systematic
     bias, not noise, and the fix is to take the direction from the average and the DISTANCE from
     the average of the candidates' own distances. **It moved the result by 0.2%.** Worth writing
     down as a thing that is theoretically right and practically negligible here, so nobody
     spends a build on it again.
  **AND A KNOB SWEEP IS WHAT SAYS THE REST IS STRUCTURAL.** K of 1/3/6 against 0/2/4 smoothing
  passes covers 10.6% to 12.0% -- the whole grid. There is no tuning left to find; the remaining
  error is genuine disagreement between two meshes.
  **NOTHING IN THE GAME READS THE OUTPUT YET.** The deltas are written to
  `models/characters/morph/` and gitignored: seconds to regenerate, and stale the moment the
  method changes. Wiring them in is its own build -- `morphAttributes` on a skinned mesh, the
  influences, and the swap path -- and is only worth it if his eye agrees with the numbers,
  **because a silhouette metric is a proxy for "does it look right" and only he can answer that.**

- **THE OUTBREAK, AND A KIND SWAP IS A RESPAWN RATHER THAN SURGERY (m162, `VIRUS`, `virusGo`,
  `bodyGone`).** *"Build the warrior thing trigger. I kinda just wanna see it. Maybe you could
  build another gun mode and I could just shoot them and it turns the civilians into aliens and
  aliens back into civilians, so I can basically debug it."* A DEBUG TRIGGER by his own
  description, written to be replaced: a vending machine, a UFO beam or hydrant goo all end up
  calling `virusGo(d)` and nothing else. **Fourth row in `WEAP.modes`** -- m52 promised a mode
  costs a row, m112 collected once, this is twice.
  **A BODY IS A `(P, K)` PAIR AND THAT IS WHY THE SWAP IS FREE.** `bodySpawn(K.P, K, x, z, y)`
  builds the model, the cloned materials, the mixer, every action, the clip table, the reference
  speeds, the bar and the smoke joint. Rewriting all of that in place is a second `bodySpawn` to
  keep in step with the first -- this repo's oldest mistake -- so one is killed and the other
  spawned at the same spot, and **a kind added tomorrow is infectable with no work at all**.
  What carries across is the place, the facing, and `wasK`: shoot the alien and he goes back to
  the civilian he came out of. A body that was ALWAYS a warrior has no `wasK`, so shooting him
  does nothing, which is right -- there is no civilian under him.
  **HE COMES OUT ANGRY (`mark`, `aggro`), because a civilian who turns and wanders off is a
  costume change.** Those two fields are what the state machine already reads.
  **REMOVING A BODY IS THE RISKY HALF, AND FIVE THINGS HOLD A REFERENCE TO ONE**: `DUMMIES`,
  another body's `foe`/`sfoe` (bodies point at each other as targets), `player.lock`,
  `spark.follow` (which holds the body itself, so a swarm would hang in the air where he was) and
  his health-bar group. **And the MATERIALS are his own while the GEOMETRY is not** -- `bodySpawn`
  clones the mats per body and shares the mesh through `skeletonClone`, so disposing the geometry
  would take it out from under every other body of that kind.
  **AND BEATING HIM DOWN REVERTS HIM, WHICH IS THE ACTUAL MECHANIC HE DESCRIBED.** *"You shoot
  him and kill him down till he's disabled, and then when he's down on the ground disabled
  enough, he shrinks back into the normal civilian character."* It hangs off the GET-UP rather
  than off damage, for a mechanical reason: **`bodyLaunch` resets `d.hp` every time** (a body gets
  up at full health, deliberately), so hp can never count knock-downs and `d.downs` has to. It
  reverts INSTEAD of getting up, so the last thing you see is him on the floor turning back.
  **AND THE TURN IS QUEUED, WHICH IS TWO BUGS AVOIDED IN ONE LINE.** That code sits inside
  `stepDummies`' own `for (const d of DUMMIES)`: `virusGo` calls `bodyGone`, which SPLICES that
  array, so turning him on the spot shifts the iterator and **the body after him is skipped**.
  And my first version used a bare `return`, which exits `stepDummies` outright and **abandons
  every remaining body for the frame**. `VTURN` is drained from `virusStep`, outside any loop over
  the list -- `brkDirty`'s rule, one system along. `mel.outbreak()` slices the list for the same
  reason.
  **`she` IS DELIBERATELY NOT INFECTABLE.** She is not in `DUMMIES`, `bodyGone` could not clean
  up after her, and a respawn would have to rebuild her whole 135-bone hair and tail chain. A
  stated gap rather than a crash.
  **AND `softNow()` WAS DELETED BEFORE IT SHIPPED.** I wrote it as "either of the two harmless
  rounds" with an argument for why the question deserves one name -- and then nothing called it,
  because there turned out to be exactly one shared gate (the ball's colour) and it reads both
  flags directly. **A helper nothing calls is dead code with a comment arguing for it.**

- **EVERYTHING BREAKS THINGS NOW, AND `brkBlast` NEVER ASKED WHO WAS SWINGING (m161).** *"A
  thrown body, you know, can run into things, break it. I do want the warriors to be able to
  break stuff."* Two call sites and no new system, because that function is a POSITION, a RADIUS
  and a DAMAGE -- which is the whole return on m160 having put the conversion in one door.
  **THE WARRIOR'S SWING SITS ABOVE EVERY EARLY RETURN IN `foeStrike`.** Those all test whether
  the blow reached a BODY, and a mace that missed you still went through the bench -- so gating
  it on a connect would have made "he can break things" mean "he can break things only while
  hitting you". At his own reach along his own heading, at chest height, which is where a mace at
  the end of a swing actually is.
  **A BODY'S DAMAGE IS ITS SPEED, WHICH IS A THIRD UNIT AND NEEDED A THIRD FACTOR (`BRK.bodyK`).**
  m160 already had to reconcile his hp scale (15-150) with `FOE.dmg` (1.9 for a full bolt); a
  flying body arrives in m/s. `FLYHIT` says the range is `at` 6 to `full` 22, so at **0.11**
  against `BRK.dmg` 12:
      6 m/s  a stagger      ->  7.9   nothing breaks in one pass, not even a crate (15)
     14 m/s  a real launch  -> 18.5   the crate goes, trashbin 25 and bench 40 do not
     22 m/s  full           -> 29.0   crate and trashbin; a dumpster (150) is untouched
  Which is the same shape `FLYHIT.at` already gives a body hitting another body.
  **AND A CAR IS DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED TO IT.** It is the identical one-liner and it is the one
  producer that runs with nobody watching: 55 cars on lanes all day against 179 breakables would
  clear the street furniture in a minute, and **a world that takes itself apart unattended is not
  a world**. The gate on `FLYHIT.at` is what makes the same argument for bodies -- a man merely
  walking about can never break anything.

- **I CAN DECODE DRACO MESHES HERE, AND HE WAS ABOUT TO RE-EXPORT SIX CHARACTERS FOR NOTHING
  (m161).** *"You said you can't look at the meshes because of Draco -- I was wondering if I
  upload the models without Draco if you'd be able to inspect that."* **That is my own note being
  misread back to me.** `CLAUDE.md` says draco decodes here and that what cannot be done is
  building a **SKIN** (which needs a mixer and a skeleton, not a decoder) -- two different things,
  and I have said "nothing here can build a skin" often enough that it heard as "nothing here can
  read a mesh". Measured rather than quoted, through `vendor/draco/draco_wasm_wrapper.js` as a

      and the attributes decoded are POSITION, NORMAL, TEXCOORD_0, **JOINTS_0, WEIGHTS_0**
  So: do NOT re-export without draco. It would only make the files bigger, and the skin weights
  -- which are the thing a correspondence needs -- come out of the compressed file already.
  **AND NONE OF THEM SHARES A TOPOLOGY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE ANSWER ABOUT BLEND SHAPES.** Six
  different vertex counts. A glTF morph target is a per-vertex DELTA on one topology, so
  "building all the characters out of the same base mesh" is not a preference, it is the
  requirement -- and it is exactly the resculpt he is trying to avoid.

- **IMPACT DECALS, AND NOTHING IS RAYCAST (m160, `DECAL`, `decalPut`, `decalHit`).** *"On a shot
  hit: raycast the hit point and normal against the collision mesh, pick a decal by weapon/kind
  ... one shared material, pooled at about 40, oldest recycled first, fading after about 20 s."*
  **THE THING THAT STOPPED THE BOLT ALREADY KNOWS WHICH FACE IT STOPPED ON.** `camHit` walks the
  boxes and `boxNear` has returned the outward normal of the nearest face since m89, so a second
  ray against the collision mesh would be a second opinion about a question that has just been
  answered -- and the two would disagree at every corner. `camHit` takes an optional `out` and
  `hitFace` fills it; every existing caller is byte-for-byte what it was.
  **A ROOF IS TOLD FROM A WALL BY THE BOX'S OWN HEIGHT**, not by the plan normal: a bolt landing
  on a roof is on the roof, and a plan normal there lays the scorch on its edge.
  **AND `alphaTest` IS .08, NOT THE .5 HE ASKED FOR.** Those two requests fight: at .5 a mark
  fading to 40% opacity does not fade, it **VANISHES IN ONE FRAME**. The cutout's real job is the
  atlas's transparent padding, which is nowhere near .5, so the test kills the padding and a
  per-vertex alpha (itemSize **4**, which is what puts `USE_COLOR_ALPHA` on) does the fading.
  **ONE DYNAMIC MESH, ONE DRAW CALL, AND THE POOL IS THE WHOLE STRUCTURE** -- 40 quads is 240
  non-indexed vertices and the oldest is overwritten. No add, no remove, no material per mark.
  **AND A DECAL IS TONE-MAPPED AND NOT ADDITIVE**, the slash mark's own lesson: additive over a
  lit surface has nowhere to go but white.
  **BOTH THE 1 cm LIFT AND `polygonOffset`**, because the lift alone loses to depth precision at
  distance and the offset alone loses on a surface seen edge-on -- and z-fighting on a wall reads
  as the wall flickering.

- **BREAKABLES: THE TAG IS THE FACT AND THE NAME MEANS NOTHING (m160, `BRK`, `brkClaim`).**
  *"Any node with userData.breakable is a breakable."* Measured before a line was written:
      179 tagged nodes, SEVEN types   dumpster 38, crate 35, trashbin 30, bench 23,
                                      lightpost 23, hydrant 20, barrel 10
      spelt THREE different ways      `prop_crate_000`, `debris_trash_014`,
                                      `brk_bench_intact_003` -- and **73 of them are NESTED**
      none of the 179 is in the obb   so its collider can only come from the breakables file
  A name regex would have found some and silently missed the rest, which is `stripPoses`' rule:
  the property that makes a thing what it is has to be the structural one.
  **THEY ARE ALREADY INSTANCED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE STORY.** 179 nodes share SEVEN
  geometries, so `buildTCity`'s pass collapses them with no help -- and breaking one is writing a
  **ZERO-SCALE matrix** into its slot, which every GPU discards before rasterisation. Taking them
  out of the instancing to make them breakable would have been 179 draw calls to buy what one
  matrix write gives. **The count is fixed and re-packing would renumber every slot after it**,
  so nothing is ever removed from an InstancedMesh here.
  **THE TAG IS READ INSIDE THE INSTANCING LOOP, where every node goes past exactly once and the
  mesh and the slot are both in hand** -- Shredworld's c142 rule about `roadTag`: a second place
  that registers breakables is a second place to forget to.
  **THREE THINGS IN HIS FILE'S SHAPE WOULD EACH HAVE SHIPPED A BUG, AND READING THE HIERARCHY IS
  WHAT CAUGHT THEM:**
  1. **THE LIBRARY IS PARKED AT x = 3300**, every type 4 m apart in z with its broken copy 3 m
     beside it. A collider measured through `matrixWorld` therefore lands **three and a third
     KILOMETRES** from the hydrant it belongs to. It is measured relative to the type's own
     `brk_<t>_intact` empty instead. (The CHUNKS need no such correction -- they are children of
     the broken group and that group's matrix is the one `brkBreak` overwrites.)
  2. **`fx_hydrant_water_spout` IS A CHILD OF `brk_hydrant_broken`**, so the chunk loop would
     have thrown an invisible empty across the street as a piece of hydrant. The test is that it
     holds no mesh, which is structural.
  3. **EVERY CHUNK CARRIES ITS OWN `col_brk_*` MESH AS A CHILD.** Cloned and added, that draws a
     second coarser copy of each chunk on top of the real one and doubles a pile's draw calls.
  **AND HIS hp SCALE AND THIS GAME'S DAMAGE SCALE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS (`BRK.dmg`).** His
  extras run 15 to 150; `FOE.dmg` is **bolt 1.9, fist .8, weap 1.3, finish 3.2** per full-power
  blow, because that scale was set by what a MAN can take. Handed straight across, a dumpster is
  a **79-SHOT** object -- which from a phone is indistinguishable from breakables not working at
  all. The conversion is explicit, it is 12, and it lives in `brkBlast`, which is the one door
  every blow comes through and therefore the one place the two cannot drift apart:
      full bolt 22.8   crate 1   trashbin 2   bench 2   hydrant 3   lightpost 3   dumpster 7
      finisher  38.4   crate 1   trashbin 1   bench 2   hydrant 2   lightpost 2   dumpster 4
  A crate goes in one shot and a dumpster is a project, which is what his own ten-to-one spread
  between them was asking for.
  **`BRK.maxWrecks` IS 6 BECAUSE A PILE IS 3-5 DRAW CALLS and he can shoot all day.** A pile
  shrinks away rather than fading -- a fade wants a material clone per chunk and a scale wants
  one number -- and the chunks' drag CONVERGES (`Math.exp(-k*dt)`), because a launch speed with
  no drag is a number that means nothing without the clock beside it (Shredworld c146, a build).
  **AND THE BOX GRID IS REBUILT ONCE A FRAME, NOT ONCE A BOX.** `boxGrid` walks all 670 of them
  and a charged shot takes out several crates on the same frame.

- **THE COLLIDER VIEW SHOWED HALF THE COLLIDER (m160, `BOXV.tri`).** *"Are we using triangles for
  colliders or are we still using the box collider? It seems like we're using the box collider."*
  Both, and the reason that had to be asked is that this view drew `BOXES` and nothing else: the
  491 oriented boxes were on screen and the ~40,000 walkable triangles under his feet were
  invisible, so the honest reading of the picture was "boxes and nothing else". **A debug view
  that shows half the thing answers the wrong question**, which is m165's own lesson one repo
  over about a car box drawn 78 cm above the car. It walks `TRI`'s own grid round him at its own
  radius, with a `seen` set because a triangle is listed once per CELL it spans and a road slab
  is in several -- so the number on screen is triangles and not cell entries. **Reserved in
  `bvCap`** rather than left to the slack, or a dense block of boxes silently eats the very thing
  it was added to show.

- **THE `fx_*` MARKERS AND THE WATER SPOUT (m160, `SPOUT`, `fxSpawn`).** Every number is in his
  marker and none is typed here: `fx: 'water_spout'`, `dir: [0,0,1]`, `height_m: 4`,
  `duration_s: 12`. A second effect is a case in `fxSpawn` and a marker on another breakable
  lands with no code change at all.
  **`dir` IS LOCAL AND HAS TO BE TURNED BY THE BREAKABLE'S OWN MATRIX.** 177 of the 179
  placements carry a yaw, so reading it as a world vector would have every hydrant in the city
  spraying due north.
  **THE LAUNCH SPEED IS SOLVED FROM `height_m`** -- `v = sqrt(2 g h)` against the pool's own
  gravity -- so the jet reaches the height he asked for and keeps reaching it if `SPK.g` moves.
  A typed speed is a height that is right once. The SPLASH is placed the same way: the flight
  time back to the ground and the horizontal reach over it, so it lands where the water lands
  rather than at the nozzle.
  **IT RIDES `spk()` RATHER THAN GETTING ITS OWN POOL.** `puffPool`'s note says what the pools
  share (a `Points` sized in world METRES) and what they do not (physics and blending) -- and a
  fountain is additive debris that FALLS, which is the spark step exactly. What it costs is
  head-room: `SPK.n` 560 -> **760**, because a pool that recycles every other effect out from
  under itself while a hydrant runs for twelve seconds is worse than a bigger buffer (m118's own
  argument about the morph).
  **THE PUDDLE IS GENERATED, BECAUSE THE ATLAS HAS NO PUDDLE IN IT** -- scorch, crater, bullet
  holes, goo and rubble, and a goo mark under a hydrant is the alien weapon's colour on a water
  effect. One 128 px canvas, made once.
  **AND THERE IS NO SPRAY SOUND, WHICH IS STATED RATHER THAN FAKED.** He asked for a looping one;
  this repo has clang / drop / foot / hit / lock / plasma / shot / swoosh / thud / zap and not one
  of them is water. `SPOUT.snd` is the hook -- name a key the day there is a recording.

- **A BOX FITTED ROUND A TURNED SHAPE IS A STAIRCASE, AND HIS COLLISION FILE WAS NEVER THE
  PROBLEM (m159, `tcObbBoxes`, `toon_city_obb.json`).** *"Your screenshot shows exactly the
  problem: a pile of little boxes stacked in stair steps, every one lined up with the world grid
  instead of the building. The collision file I sent is correct. The skew happens in the game
  code: it breaks each building into small world-aligned boxes, and since almost nothing in this
  city sits at a right angle, every wall turns into a staircase."*
  Right on every count, and it is m129's finding about the Weirdport cars arriving a second time
  one asset along: **the AABB of a rotated shape is always bigger than the shape and pointed the
  wrong way**, and `solidColumns` was making thousands of them per building.
  **THE ANSWER IS TWO HALVES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS WHAT HE ASKED FOR FIRST.** *"Feed their
  triangles through the same triangle path as the ground (`triAdd`), and just treat them as
  solid instead of walkable."*
      WALKABLE  yes, and it costs nothing: `triAdd` SELF-SELECTS -- it keeps only what faces up,
                so a dumpster gives its lid, a slanted wall gives the slant, a kerb gives its
                top and every vertical face drops out by itself. Exact, leaning, curved.
      SOLID     **`triAdd` cannot do this and saying so is the point.** `triGround` returns a
                HEIGHT: the triangle collider is a HEIGHTFIELD, and the faces that would stop
                him walking through a wall are precisely the ones it has just thrown away.
                What stops him is `resolveBoxes`, and that wants boxes.
  So the walls are `toon_city_obb.json`, which he exported for exactly this: 491 oriented boxes,
  71 buildings / 231 props / 189 posts, each the smallest box that fits its object when turned
  to match it. **AND IT NEEDED NO COLLISION CODE AT ALL** -- `resolveBoxes`, `groundAt`,
  `boxNear` and `camHit` have all tested a turned box in its OWN FRAME since m146, built for the
  cars for this exact reason. It is a loader and nothing else.
  **THE YAW IS NEGATED, AND IT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED.** A three.js rotation of `t`
  about +Y maps local +X to `(cos t, 0, -sin t)`; melee's `b.cs`/`b.sn` are written so local +X
  maps to `(cs, sn)` in (x, z), which is `-t`. This file gets handedness backwards about half
  the time when it reasons, so both signs were run against his own collision geometry -- his
  file is plain glTF, so every vertex of all 71 buildings is readable here in a second:
      yaw = -t   worst vertex outside its box **0.0011 m**, mean 0.00001   <- shipped
      yaw = +t   worst **2.7283 m**, mean 0.197
  One millimetre over 5,271 vertices is the box sitting on the building. **And it is taken off
  the QUATERNION the file carries, not off its `yaw` field**, whose sign convention would have
  been ours to assume.
  **AND THE AABB IS STILL BUILT, because it is the BROAD PHASE.** Every one of those callers
  rejects on `minx/maxx/minz/maxz` before it looks at `cs`, so a turned box with no world-
  aligned bounds is a box nothing ever tests.
  **WHAT HIS COLLISION FILE ACTUALLY HOLDS, measured:** 78 meshes, 37,702 triangles -- 4 ground,
  **71 buildings**, and only 2 props and 1 solid. So the buildings get exact walkable roofs and
  ledges from triangles AND exact walls from boxes, while the 231 props and 189 posts are boxes
  only: a dumpster's top comes from its box's `maxy`, which is right but FLAT. **Rolling off a
  leaning dumpster's real slope wants that dumpster's triangles in the collision file**, and
  that is a stated gap rather than a silent one.

- **THE SWAP ANIMATION WAS AN OVERRIDE IN ONLY ONE OF THE TWO GAIT BRANCHES (m159).** *"When he
  switches from the blaster to the melee weapon, the animation doesn't play in between those
  two. It plays between most of the other ones."* Exactly right, and it was WHERE the override
  lived rather than what it did -- `rigAnim`'s `SPLIT.up` block sat at the BOTTOM of the
  ordinary gait, and `if (gunOut()) { ...; return; }` sits above it.
  **`gunOut()` READS `player.slot`, WHICH IS STILL THE OLD SLOT UNTIL `applySlot` FIRES AT
  `SWAP.at`** -- and the blaster is the only slot with `aim`, which is what makes his "most of
  the other ones" the exact tell:
      none -> blaster    slot 0 for the first 48%, so the reach plays and then STOPS DEAD
      blaster -> hammer  slot 1 for the first 48%, so the half that matters (the hand going
                         INTO the bag) is silent and the weight fades in past the middle
      hammer -> none     slot 2 throughout, so it plays -- "most of the other ones"
  **AN OVERRIDE THAT ONLY EXISTS IN ONE OF TWO BRANCHES IS NOT AN OVERRIDE**, so it is hoisted
  above both rather than copied into the second -- one `L` and one `add`, read by each.
  **AND `aimIdle` HAD TO JOIN `SPLIT.legs` FOR THAT TO BE SAFE.** Without a `__legs` half, `L()`
  falls back to the WHOLE rifle idle, which keys the arms -- and averaging two clips that both
  key an arm is a shrug, which is what m19 paid a build for. **Sixth time: when a feature does
  nothing, check WHERE it is called before what it does.**

- **THE BOARD STEERED BY `rel` AND `rel` IS THE FOLD (m159).** *"The left stick on the
  skateboard just goes the direction that you push. If he's facing 90 degrees to the left but
  you push up, he should turn to go that way. Right now it's relative to his position -- if he's
  facing left and I push down he turns to the left. It's not working the same way it works in
  Shred World."* It is Shredworld's c164 landmine word for word, and the line is one character
  of intent away from right:
      const rel = Math.abs(ang) > PI/2 ? wrapAngle(ang - PI) : ang;   // the PUSH/BRAKE fold
      p.boardH += clamp(rel * 3, ...)                                 // ...used to STEER
  `rel` folds the thumb onto the NEAREST END of the board, so a thumb more than ninety degrees
  off his nose brought his TAIL round to it -- the far side of the circle, which is away from
  where it points. **`ang` is already the signed shortest rotation from his nose to the thumb,
  so it is the whole answer**; the fold survives only where it belongs, deciding push from
  brake. The stick was always camera-relative (`stickWorld`) -- that half was never wrong.
  **AND THE BRAKE HAD TO BE LATCHED WITH IT (`p.braked`, `SK8.brakeZone`).** Steering by `ang`
  means a thumb held behind him carves him round to face it, `fwdC` flips positive, the brake
  becomes a push, and a held brake reads as a 180 into an acceleration -- Shredworld's c163.
  **AND THE ZONE IS NOT A SIGN TEST**: a thumb held exactly sideways puts `fwdC` at +/-1e-17 and
  whether he is braking would be decided by rounding.

- **CARRYING A BOARD IS NOT RIDING IT (m159, `p.riding`, `boardHeld`, `SK8.hold`).** *"When it's
  equipped you're just holding it in your hand. You can align it to the weapon joint. The way
  you get on it is you swipe up on the left stick... and to get off, maybe a swipe down."*
  Two facts, so two flags: the SLOT says he has a board and `p.riding` says it is under his feet.
  **AND THE GESTURE COST NOTHING, WHICH IS WHY IT FITS.** Not riding, the left pad's flick is the
  dodge roll -- so the mount takes only the UP half and a sideways or backward flick still rolls.
  Riding, `boardFlick` already returned 1 for every GROUND flick and did nothing with it ("a
  ground flick is deliberately nothing"), so the dismount spends a slot that was already empty.
  **The air flicks are the two body flips and are untouched**, which is why the dismount is
  grounded-only -- a flick down in the air is the back flip and always was.
  **HELD, IT IS PLACED OFF THE MOUNT'S WORLD MATRIX AND NEVER PARENTED TO IT.** The bone lives
  inside an armature scaled 0.01 and the deck group is in metres, so a child of it would draw a
  centimetre wide -- the blaster's own mount note pointed the other way, and Shredworld's title
  card paid for it once. Copy the bone's position and rotation, DISCARD its scale.
  **AND NOTHING MAY TOUCH `rotation.order` AFTER `quaternion.copy`**: writing it fires Object3D's
  euler callback, which rebuilds the quaternion from a stale euler and throws the bone away.
  **WHERE EXACTLY IT SITS IN HIS HAND IS A LOOK-AT-IT DECISION AND IS HIS.** The one fact about
  that bone's convention is that the blaster's barrel runs along its -X, so the deck's length is
  laid along it and everything else is a dial: `mel.SK8.hold`, `mel.hold()` prints the line to
  paste back, `mel.ride()` puts him on and off without a gesture.

- **THE KTX2 BAKE, AND THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS IS RESIDENT MEMORY (m158, `npm run ktx`,
  `tools/ktx.mjs`, `vendor/KTX2Loader.js`).** *"Texture memory is the real problem, and KTX2 is
  the right fix. Tell it yes to the UASTC to KTX2 tool."*
  **IT REWRITES THE GLB RAW AND NEVER DECODES A MESH, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.** The obvious
  build is gltf-transform, and that has to DECODE draco to read the file and RE-ENCODE it to
  write one -- so the geometry that comes out is not the geometry that went in, and a re-encode
  artefact would surface as "the city looks different" with nothing pointing at this tool. Here
  the JSON chunk is edited, the image bufferViews are replaced and **every other bufferView is
  copied byte for byte** -- and the tool ASSERTS that, reading its own output back and comparing
  all 1,237 of them. "It produced a file" is not "it produced a GLB".
  **AND THE TWO ENCODERS ARE A REAL TRADE, MEASURED ON HIS OWN FILE RATHER THAN QUOTED:**
      as authored   WebP   5.6 MB of image data   **176 MB RESIDENT**  (32 @ 1024, 4 @ 512)
      UASTC + zstd         38.4 MB                 ~44 MB   <- near-lossless, 47 MB to download
      **ETC1S q200          7.6 MB                 ~22 MB**  <- SHIPPED
  **UASTC IS THE WRONG TRADE ON A PHONE AND IT IS NOT CLOSE.** It is the better picture and it
  is a **47 MB download** against 14.7; ETC1S costs two megabytes on the wire and takes the
  memory to an eighth. On hand-painted flat colour and grunge, 4 bpp holds up; on smooth
  gradients it would not, and that is the thing to look at if a future sheet is a sky or a
  gradient ramp. `npm run ktx <glb>` is UASTC, `npm run ktx <glb> etc1s` is this.
  **`detectSupport(renderer)` IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS THE SILENT HALF.** It tells the transcoder
  which format the DEVICE has -- ASTC on most phones, BC7 on a desktop, ETC2 as the floor -- and
  without it every KTX2 comes back transcoded to plain RGBA: **the whole 176 MB back, with an
  extra decode in front of it**, and nothing on screen saying the saving did not happen.
  **THE TRANSCODER IS LAZY, SO THE OTHER TWO WORLDS PAY NOTHING.** `KTX2Loader.init()` runs on
  the first KTX2 texture it is handed, so the 527 KB of wasm is never fetched unless something
  asks. The import itself is ktx-parse + zstddec, about 40 KB.
  **AND THE LOADER IS ATTACHED UNCONDITIONALLY**, not only in the toon world: GLTFLoader throws
  outright for a file that REQUIRES an extension with no loader for it, and a world that fails
  to boot over a loader nobody attached is the one failure he cannot look at and correct.
  **FOUR VENDORED FILES AND TWO EDITS TO ONE OF THEM.** `KTX2Loader.js`, `WorkerPool.js`,
  `ktx-parse.module.js`, `zstddec.module.js` and `basis/` came out of `npm pack three@0.180.0`
  (**unpkg is blocked by the egress proxy -- 403 on CONNECT; npm is not**), and `KTX2Loader.js`
  imports were repointed at `./` plus one real fix: it imports `DisplayP3ColorSpace` and
  `LinearDisplayP3ColorSpace` from `'../math/ColorSpaces.js'`, **and the minified r180 build this
  repo vendors does not export either**. They are plain string constants in three's source and
  are inlined, rather than patching a build we do not own.
  **AND THE BOOT GATE'S FAKE RENDERER NEEDED AN `extensions` OBJECT** -- without it
  `detectSupport` throws at module scope, which is a blank page, which is the one class that
  gate exists for. It caught this on the first run. It answers NO to every format, which is what
  a headless node honestly has, and `get()` returns undefined for a format `has()` just refused
  rather than inventing an object -- m192's rule, that a stub answering every question cannot
  catch a wrong one.
  **AND A BACKTICK IN A COMMENT INSIDE THE SHIM'S TEMPLATE LITERAL CLOSED IT**, which is a
  syntax error pointing at a line that is fine. Shredworld's c145 and c136, third time across
  these repos, and the first time in `boot.mjs`. There are none in there now.
  **HIS OWN EXPORT IS UNTOUCHED AT `toon_city_visual.glb` AND THE BAKE IS A SECOND FILE.** He
  re-exports onto the same path constantly (m61), so a tool that overwrites its own input eats
  his next export the first time somebody runs it twice -- and `TCITY.raw` is the A/B and is
  what to point at the day the bake is stale.

- **HIS COLLISION, HIS TINT, AND THE RE-EXPORT CARRIES `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` (m158).**
  *"Its build reads no colliders because it hasn't seen the collision file yet... the objects
  follow your `road_`, `ground_`, `bld_`, `prop_` and `solid_` naming, and the `metal` material
  marks grindable surfaces. Also hand it `weirdkit_tint.js`, or the walls will look flatter."*
  **THE COLLISION IS `buildWpCollision`'S SHAPE WITH HIS NAMING IN IT.** Measured first: 78
  nodes, 52,614 tris, 7 materials, **no draco**, 0 negative-determinant nodes.
      road_city            2 tris  asphalt   y 0.00 flat   <- ONE QUAD under the whole map
      ground_sidewalks  2,862      concrete  y 0.25 flat        ground_lots  682  grass
      ground_curbs      8,586      metal+concrete  y 0..0.28
      bld_* (71)       10,258      wall           prop_street  24,730      prop
      prop_tree_trunks  3,286      wood           solid_posts   2,208      prop+metal
  **NOT ONE OF THE 78 IS A 12-TRIANGLE BOX**, which is the shortcut Weirdport's 329 props take,
  so every solid here goes through the rasteriser and that shortcut is dead code on this file.
  **AND THE WHOLE GROUND MESH GOES INTO `triAdd` UNSORTED**, because it throws away anything
  steeper than `TRI.up` by itself -- a kerb's SIDE and every underside drop out with nothing
  separated by hand.
  **THE GRIND CAME FREE.** m153 catches the top edge of any solid box near him and `BOXES` IS
  the rail set, so his `metal` kerbs and posts are grindable with **no code at all**; the names
  are collected into `mel.TCITY.rails` so which they were is answerable.
  **THE TINT IS PORTED, NOT IMPORTED, AND THE THREE DIFFERENCES ARE WHY.** (1) An instance
  `onBeforeCompile` SHADOWS the prototype's completely, so his hook as written would have taken
  the toon ramp and the paint pass off every wall in the city -- m141's whole finding -- so it
  chains `toonPatch` and `paintPatch`. (2) It is patched LAST so it ends up FIRST in the shader,
  because his replace and `paintPatch` both target `#include <color_fragment>` and the tint has
  to settle the base colour before the paint splotches it. (3) `extras` reach `userData` through
  GLTFLoader, so `wk_tint` is read there. The shader body is his, verbatim.
  **AND AN `InstancedMesh` MUST BE SKIPPED BY BOTH PASSES, WHICH IS NEW AND WAS A LATENT
  DISASTER.** His re-export carries `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` -- 45 nodes holding 99 instances --
  and GLTFLoader turns each into a real `InstancedMesh`. **`isInstancedMesh` is also `isMesh`**,
  so m157's instancing pass would have grouped two of them and built an InstancedMesh OF
  InstancedMeshes: three reads `instanceMatrix` off the OUTER one, the inner 99 placements are
  never looked at, and **98 of his objects vanish with nothing on screen saying why.** The merge
  pass is the same fault wearing the other face -- `applyMatrix4` on the geometry would flatten
  every instance onto one. Caught by reading the new file's extension list before writing, not
  by running it.
  **AND `TCITY.tex` IS 0 NOW.** *"Its size cap can go back up to full size, since the textures
  are already 1024 or smaller."* Measured on the new export: 32 @ 1024, 4 @ 512, 176 MB resident
  against the first export's 268. The runtime downscale has nothing left to do and a canvas
  redraw of every texture at load is cost for no benefit; it stays as the dial for a future one.

- **HIS LIGHTING SPEC, AND TWO OF ITS FOUR POINTS WERE ALREADY SHIPPED (m158, `LIGHTX`,
  `stepLightX`).** *"One warm key sun that casts shadows, low and golden, 25-35 degrees... keep
  this as the only shadow caster... two or three directional lights with NO shadows for shape...
  a hemisphere light: warm from the sky, dark purple from the ground."*
  **POINTS 1 AND 2a HAVE BEEN IN THE FILE SINCE m140** and are confirmed rather than rebuilt:
  `sun` is the only shadow caster, it sits at **30 degrees** (his own m140 pick out of 12/30/57,
  squarely in the 25-35 he asked for), and its shadow camera is a 44 m box that FOLLOWS HIM
  (m124) at 46 texels per metre. `fill` is the cool blue from the opposite side, casting nothing.
  **A RIM LIGHT COMES FROM BEHIND THE SUBJECT, NOT FROM BEHIND THE CAMERA.** His sentence says
  both -- *"from behind the camera's usual direction"* and *"so building edges and characters
  catch a colored edge"* -- and only one of those puts light on an EDGE: a lamp behind the lens
  is a frontal fill and flattens everything, which is the opposite of the ask. So it sits on the
  far side of him along the view direction and shines back toward the camera, and **the sign is
  settled by what a rim light IS rather than derived**, which is this file's own handedness rule.
  **AND IT FOLLOWS `cam.az`, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS NOT A CONSTANT.** A fixed bearing
  rims one wall of the city; a bearing that tracks the lens rims whatever he is looking at. Not
  physical, and exactly what a rim light is for in a game. **Stepped AFTER `stepCam`**, or it is
  placed off last frame's bearing and trails every swing -- `stepShip`'s ordering rule, and a
  colour sitting on an edge is where a frame of lag shows.
  **AND A DirectionalLight's `target` DEFAULTS TO THE ORIGIN.** Left there, the rim is only
  correct while he stands on the spawn; both targets are moved to the look point and are in the
  scene graph, because three reads a target's WORLD matrix and one outside the graph never has
  one updated for it.
  **THE COST IS FRAGMENT WORK AND IT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** Neither casts -- a
  shadow-casting light re-draws the whole city, which at 22 fps is not available -- but three
  directional lights become five, so every lit pixel runs two more iterations of the lighting
  loop, maybe **5 to 8 per cent on a fill-bound frame**. `RIM` on the FX key is the A/B, because
  at 22 fps that is a measurement he can take and I cannot.
  **AND STREETLIGHTS, NEON AND WINDOWS GET NO LIGHTS AT ALL**, which is his point 4 and is right:
  a `PointLight` is a per-fragment cost on every surface in range. His export already carries the
  emissives (`WK_M_glass_lit`, `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`) and the ground pools are decals
  he is drawing. Nothing here adds a light for them and nothing should.

- **THE TOON CITY: A THIRD WORLD, AND THE OPTIMISATION IS 2,327 DRAW CALLS DOWN TO 72 (m157,
  `TCITY`, `buildTCity`, `inTC`).** *"I added a new level/environment, we need to setup and test
  out. I've been developing it in Blender and need to work out what needs to be optimized or
  instanced. Can we load it into its own level. There's no colliders yet so just a flat plane for
  ground and walkability."*
  **MEASURED OFF THE FILE BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN**, which is the whole answer to his question:
      1,382 nodes / 159 meshes / **1,104 primitives** / 43 materials / 471,364 tris
      184 x 20 x 182 m, ground at y ~ 0, **0 negative-determinant nodes**, no skins, no anims
      draco + EXT_texture_webp, 36 embedded images: 27 @ 1254, 7 @ 1024, 2 @ 512
      top-level names: `road_wr_*`, `ground_wr_*`, `bld_wk_*`, `bld_hero_*`, `AS_*`
  **GLTFLoader GIVES ONE MESH PER PRIMITIVE, SO "1,104 primitives on 1,382 nodes" IS 2,327 DRAW
  CALLS.** A phone wants a few hundred; triangles are the last thing that costs anything here and
  draw calls are the first. It splits cleanly and each half has an answer this file already owns:
      1,257 meshes share  34 geometries -> ONE InstancedMesh each      34 draws
      1,058 meshes on 25 material+attribute buckets -> MERGED          25 draws
         12 left alone (one of their kind)                             12 draws
      -> **72**, plus the ground plane. Simulated through the SHIPPED grouping keys against the
      real file, not estimated.
  **AND THE TEST FOR AN INSTANCE IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A PREFIX.** `buildWpVisual` keys on `inst_`
  because that exporter named them; here **a geometry used more than once IS an instance**, which
  needs no naming convention and cannot go stale when he renames a collection. `stripPoses`' own
  rule, one asset over. (His names would have worked too -- `AS_soda_can` x183, `AS_pl_weed_small`
  x86 -- which is exactly why the structural test is free to prefer.)
  **THE BUCKET IS KEYED ON THE ATTRIBUTE SET AS WELL AS THE MATERIAL, AND THAT IS NOT TIDINESS.**
  `mergeGeometries` returns **null** for a bucket whose members disagree, and the obvious handling
  -- skip it -- is a silent hole in the world: the picture is gone, the collider (here, nothing)
  is unaffected, and **nothing on screen says so.** This file has three sets (1,026 prims with
  COLOR_0, 43 with COLOR_0+COLOR_1, 35 with neither), so splitting by set means every bucket
  merges BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck and no vertex colour is dropped to make one fit.
  Shredworld's c142, which cost a third of a city. **A refused merge KEEPS the originals** and
  says `TC n NOMERGE` in the chip -- it costs the draw calls and loses nothing.
  **A MULTI-MATERIAL MESH IS LEFT ALONE, AND MY FIRST VERSION SILENTLY DUPLICATED IT.** I filtered
  a material's `groups` out of the clone before merging -- and `mergeGeometries(parts, false)`
  merges the WHOLE geometry and ignores groups, so every material's bucket would have got the
  whole mesh and drawn it once per material. GLTFLoader gives a multi-primitive mesh a GROUP of
  Meshes rather than one Mesh with a material array, so there are none in this file and it would
  have sat there latent. Caught by reading the composition rather than by running it.
  **THE BIGGEST SINGLE COST IS NOT DRAW CALLS, IT IS TEXTURE MEMORY, AND IT IS NOT CLOSE.**
  9.6 MB on the wire and **~268 MB RESIDENT** as RGBA with mips -- 226 of it in the twenty-seven
  1254s alone. Compression in the FILE only ever buys download time; the GPU holds it
  uncompressed. That is m25's lesson at twenty-seven times the count, and **on iOS it does not
  throw: it kills the tab, which comes back as the game reloading** (m133).
      tex 0 (as authored)  ~268 MB     tex 1024  ~192     tex 768  ~115 (DEFAULT)   tex 512  ~50
  **THE REAL FIX IS NEVER A SMALLER MAP** -- it is `gltf-transform uastc` (or `etc1s`) to KTX2,
  which stays GPU-COMPRESSED IN MEMORY: 268 MB becomes about 67 with the same picture at the same
  1254 px. The downscale is a floor under the tab until that bake exists, it is ONE CANVAS DRAW
  PER IMAGE at load (deduped by texture uuid, because 43 materials share 36 images), and it
  **closes the source ImageBitmap** so the decoded original is not held alongside the canvas.
  It is on a dial because how much resolution to give up is a look-at-it decision and those are
  his: `mel.TCITY.tex = 0` is the A/B at full resolution.
  **28 OF THE 43 MATERIALS ARE `doubleSided`, WHICH IS THE BLENDER DEFAULT AND NOT A DECISION.**
  On a closed shell that is pure wasted fill on the one part of a mobile GPU that is actually
  scarce. **But a LEAF is not a shell** -- ivy, weeds, stickers and graffiti are cards and
  genuinely need both faces -- so the test is the material's own transparency, which is the
  structural difference between a card and a wall, rather than a list of names to keep in step
  with his export.
  **"FLAT GROUND AND WALKABILITY" IS THE ABSENCE OF THE TWO WORLD BUILDERS, NOT A THIRD KIND OF
  GROUND.** With `TRI.on` false and `BOXES` empty, `groundAt` already returns 0 everywhere,
  `resolveBoxes` and `camHit` are no-ops and the bolt flies until `boltLife`. So the level needed
  no collider code at all -- only a visible plane so he is not standing over a void, sat at
  `groundY` -0.02 so his own asphalt wins the depth test.
  **AND A THIRD WORLD IS A THIRD PREDICATE, NOT AN `else`.** Every `if (inWP()) ... else` in this
  file reads "Weirdport or the test site", and with a third world that `else` quietly becomes
  "anything that is not Weirdport" -- so the toon city would have grown the test site's ten grey
  boxes, its two grids, its painted street layout, its building, its tower and its motorcycle, in
  the middle of his level. `inTest()` and `inTC()`, and each `else` was asked the question it
  actually means. **This is the shape to check first the day there is a fourth.**
  **THE LOOSE `tex/` JPEGS ARE NOT REFERENCED BY THE GLB** -- all 36 images are bufferViews, so
  those eight files are his Blender sources riding along, 3 MB the phone never fetches. Harmless,
  and they are why `models/toon_city/tex` went into `DIRS` beside `models/toon_city`: **twelfth
  time**, and a folder that is not there goes stale silently.
  **THE COST OF MERGING, STATED: a bucket spans the whole map and never culls.** `WK_M_trim` is
  111,266 tris in ONE draw across 184 m, so nothing in it is ever frustum-culled -- which is the
  right trade at 60 draws down to 1 on a map where the fog reaches 300 m anyway, and is the thing
  to revisit if it ever wants streaming. The InstancedMeshes DO compute real bounds, so a weed
  pack spread over the map loses nothing and a cluster in one alley culls from everywhere else.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** every GLB rejects headless, so **`buildTCity` has never run
  outside a browser** -- whether 72 draws at 471k tris and ~115 MB of texture is playable, whether
  768 is enough resolution, and whether the FrontSide forcing flattens something that needed two
  faces are all device questions. The arithmetic that CAN be checked here was, above, through the
  shipped grouping keys. All three worlds boot (`MEL_WORLD=toon npm run check:boot`). The chip
  carries `TC72d`, because "it never loaded", "it loaded and the optimisation did nothing" and
  "it loaded and it is slow anyway" are three bugs and one picture from a phone.
  **NOT DONE:** no colliders (his own words), no spawn search (0,0 is harmless with no solids),
  and the bodies still stand at their test-site coordinates -- which in a 184 m city centred on
  the origin puts them near the middle and gives him a scale reference, so it is left.

- **THE RAGDOLL IS THE HAIR SOLVER WITH A SECOND SET OF CHAINS, AND IT ALREADY HAD THE JOINT
  LIMITS (m156, `DOLL`, `dollInit`, `dollStep`).** *"It would be kinda interesting to try to make
  a rag doll affect when you get hit but with limited joint rotations for realism and the ease to
  lay down/get up."* Every one of those three is something `chainStep` already does.
  **m28-m33 BUILT ALL OF IT FOR HER HAIR AND NOBODY WROTE DOWN THAT IT WAS GENERAL.** Verlet
  particles, distance constraints, **a CONE LIMIT on every joint** -- which is "limited joint
  rotations" literally -- a per-substep speed cap measured relative to the pin, correction
  metering (`snap`), and a fixed substep so a 120 Hz phone plays the same solve as a 30 Hz one.
  It is written against `skin.chains` / `skin.hulls` / `skin.chainT` / `skin.model`, so a ragdoll
  is a second VIEW object handed to the same function. **Two small additions and nothing else:**
  a floor clamp in the constraint pass, and a WEIGHT on `chainWrite`.
  **AND IT IS A LAG AROUND THE AUTHORED POSE, NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR IT.** `C.home[i]` is what the
  spring pulls back toward; for hair that is the REST pose, and here it is refreshed from the
  MIXER'S OUTPUT every frame. That one choice is what makes this cheap AND safe:
      the limbs swing, trail and settle AROUND the fall clip instead of collapsing away from it
      `HURT.down` still lands him flat before he arrives (m96) and the get-up still stands him up
      it cannot go anywhere catastrophic, because the thing it is pulled to is always a real pose
      and **the blend in and out is ONE NUMBER**, which is the "ease" he asked for by name
  **A FULL RAGDOLL -- rigid bodies, real joints, world collision -- IS A PHYSICS ENGINE**, and
  that is a dependency and its own build. This is the useful part of the look for a solver the
  file already pays for.
  **`chainWrite` SETS RATHER THAN PREMULTIPLIES, WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NOTHING TO TAKE OFF.**
  `aimTwist` is a per-bone edit ON TOP of the mixer and needed `aimUntwist` before it or it
  unravelled (m128); this writes an absolute local quaternion, so the mixer overwriting it next
  frame is the whole reset. The weight is a `slerp` toward that, from whatever the clip wrote.
  **THE CHAINS ARE NAMED, WHICH WOULD BE WRONG FOR HAIR AND IS RIGHT HERE.** `findChains` is
  structural (*"no clip moves it"*) because hair has no naming convention and every export spells
  it differently; a BODY's does -- every character in this game is a Mixamo rig and m143/m144
  measured all fourteen against zap's bind pose. Matched on the SUFFIX, `MORPH.needs`' own rule,
  so a prefix change costs nothing. Five chains: spine+neck+head, both arms, both legs.
  **AND IT LETS GO INTO THE GET-UP RATHER THAN ON A CLOCK OF ITS OWN (`DOLL.lead`).** `p.knockDur`
  is when the stand-up fires and it is **SOLVED PER LAUNCH** (m96: `HURT.mark / (air * lead)`), so
  it is a different number every time -- a second timer would be a second thing to keep in step
  with one that moves. Releasing `lead` seconds before it means the physics is gone by the frame
  the get-up starts and there is nothing to hand over. `inT` .06 in (a hit is an impulse, not a
  fade) against `outT` .45 out.
  **IT IS BUILT IN `mphWear`, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THAT KNOWS WHICH BODY IS DRAWN.** The
  chains hold BONE references, so a disguise leaves them pointing at a skeleton no longer in the
  scene -- `WEAP.worn`'s own m122 lesson, one system over -- and building it there means every
  wearable body gets its own with no second path and nothing to remember.
  **AND IT IS STEPPED AFTER THE ROOT IS PLACED, NOT ONLY AFTER THE MIXER.** The pin is a bone's
  WORLD position and the speed cap is measured against how far it moved, so solving before
  `rig.root.position.copy(player.pos)` measures LAST frame's travel -- which at a knock-down's
  12 m/s is most of a metre of phantom motion through every limb, every frame. `stepShip`'s
  ordering rule, one system along.
  **THE FLOOR IS `DOLL.clear` ABOVE THE GROUND, NOT ZERO.** A hand resting exactly in the tarmac
  plane z-fights the road it is lying on.
  **AND THERE ARE NO HULLS, WHICH IS A STATED GAP.** `doll.hulls` is empty, so a limb can pass
  into his own torso. Her hair has head/chest/hips spheres for exactly this and it is the one
  thing that made THAT read as hair rather than as broken; here the arms are pinned at the
  shoulder under a .85 cone and cannot reach far, so it is left out rather than guessed at.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin (draco wants a
  Worker) and there is no GPU, so **whether it reads as a body or as jelly is a device question**
  and so is every one of the five cones. Both gates pass in both worlds. The chip carries
  `FALL1.02/d0.84` -- "it never fired", "it fired and the pose is wrong" and "it fired and never
  let go" are three bugs and one picture from a phone. `mel.DOLL.on = 0` is the one word back to
  m155, live, and `mel.DOLL` / `mel.doll` are both on the handle.

- **TWO SCRATCH FAMILIES ONE LETTER APART, AND I REACHED INTO THE WRONG ONE (m155).** *"Tries to
  double jump on the skateboard and something happened"* -- with a photograph of the crash
  overlay, which printed the whole answer:
      TypeError: out.push is not a function ... 'out.push(BOXES[b])'
      @ https://colinwillow.github.io/melee/:6081:108
  `_bnG`/`_bnR`/`_bnW`/`_bnL`/`_bnC` are ARRAYS for `boxesNear`; `_bnpG`/`_bnpC`/`_bnpW`/`_bnpL`
  are `{d, nx, nz, cx, cz}` POINT RECORDS for `boxNear`. m153's `railNear` needed a sixth array,
  and I created `_bnpR` in the point family and handed it to `boxesNear` -- **a hard TypeError on
  the frame he tapped in the air over anything**, which on a board is the second tap of a double
  jump, and the first thing anybody tries.
  **THE CRASH TRAP IS WHY THIS COST ONE ROUND RATHER THAN FIVE.** A phone has no console; that
  overlay is the first script in the head, before the import map and before the module, and it
  named the function, the expression, the file and the line. Every earlier report of this shape
  in these repos cost three to six builds.
  **AND THE SYNTAX GATE CATCHES THE CLASS NOW.** `boxesNear`'s last argument has to be an
  identifier the file declares as `[]`. Crude, a source-shape test, and it costs nothing and
  always runs -- the same argument the `poseColin` check above it is written under. **Verified
  both ways**: green on the fixed file, `WRONG SCRATCH KIND` on the bug put back.
  **AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THE GATE CRIED WOLF.** It tested the NAME (`/^_bn[A-Z]/`) and
  flagged `_bvL`, the collider view's own perfectly good array. **What makes a scratch the right
  kind is its DECLARATION, not its name** -- `stripPoses`' rule, one gate along -- and a check
  that fails correct code is a check people learn to ignore.

- **A MEMO THAT SKIPS THE SIDE EFFECT ITS CALLER DEPENDS ON (m154, `tools/skate.mjs`).** *"When
  I was skateboarding, and I jumped up in the air and then swiped down on the left stick, I
  think it froze the system."* Down on the left pad is the BACK FLIP, and `back_flip` is the
  **only clip in the set with a trim** -- so the swipe he named is the one path with a bug in
  it, and the bug is mine from m152.
  **38 OF ITS 60 SAMPLERS HAD AN INPUT AND AN OUTPUT OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS.** The first version
  took a trim TIME, worked out which key it fell on while copying the INPUT accessor, and
  stashed that index in a variable for the OUTPUT to read -- which works exactly once. `push`
  MEMOISES by accessor, and `back_flip`'s 60 channels share two time accessors, so from the
  second channel on the input came back cached, **the index was never recomputed**, and the
  output was copied from zero: 43 rotation values against 31 times, every value twelve frames
  out of step with the time it is keyed at. It parses, it plays, and what comes out is a pose
  nobody authored.
  **THE FIX IS TO HAVE NO SIDE EFFECT**: `trimIndex` decides it once per (accessor, shift) and
  both halves of the sampler are handed it.
  **AND A SECOND FAULT UNDER IT: THE DURATION LIED.** A bone that does not move is exported as
  TWO keys spanning the whole clip, and two keys cannot be trimmed -- so re-basing each
  accessor to its OWN first time left those holds reaching 1.767 s while the real motion ended
  at 1.400, and `clip.duration` is the MAX over every track. **A duration that lies is worse
  than an untrimmed clip**, because `trickDur` and the playback rate are both solved from it:
  the flip was being stretched over 26% more time than it has motion in. The shift is the
  CLIP'S, taken off its longest time accessor and applied to every track in it. 1.767 -> 1.400,
  which is Shredworld's own 1.77 -> 1.37 to the frame.
  **AND THE TOOL CHECKS ITS OWN OUTPUT NOW**, because this is silent: a sampler whose two
  halves disagree produces a valid file. **Verified by reintroducing the bug in a copy** -- it
  exits 1 with `38 samplers have input/output counts that disagree` -- which is the only thing
  that proves a guard is a guard.
  **WHAT I COULD NOT REPRODUCE IS A FREEZE**, and that is stated rather than dressed up. There
  is no unbounded loop on that path and nothing in this container has a GPU. What IS certain is
  that the one clip he named was malformed, and two hardenings went in beside the fix: leaving
  the board CLEARS what the board owns (`p.trick`, `p.rail`, the two spins -- `stepSkate` is the
  only thing that steps them, so a state left set when the slot changes is one nothing can ever
  end, and `boardFlick` refuses on `p.trick`, so it would have been one flip and then none for
  the rest of the session), and a clip whose length is not a positive number is refused rather
  than dividing into a **NaN `timeScale`, which on a mixer is every bone in the body gone**.

- **A GRIND RAIL IS THE TOP EDGE OF A SOLID BOX -- FOUND, NEVER AUTHORED (m153, `SK8.grind`,
  `railNear`, `railCatch`, `stepGrind`).** *"Should we just build some procedural rails and put
  in grinding, or did you mean animations? It'd be nice to be able to slide on cars and stuff,
  but I feel like we don't have collide boxes -- you're just gonna be grinding on benches,
  rails, kerbs, cars."*
  **THE ANSWER IS NO PROCEDURAL RAILS, AND HIS OWN SENTENCE IS WHY.** The boxes are already
  there: 4,104 in Weirdport -- every bench, kerb, planter, parapet, plaza rail and ledge iron
  -- plus the 24 driving cars and the ten in the test site. A placed rail set would be a SECOND
  description of the same edges: one to author, one to keep in step with the collider, and one
  to be wrong. `ledgeFind`'s rule (m102), one verb along, and the rails' and bars' rule one
  repo over.
  **AND `boxNear` ALREADY GIVES THE LINE.** It returns the closest point on a box's FOOTPRINT
  and that face's outward NORMAL, in the box's own oriented frame since m146 -- so the edge
  through that point is the horizontal perpendicular to the normal, and how long it is, is the
  box's own half extent on the OTHER axis. Nothing is derived, nothing is authored, and **a car
  parked at an angle or driving past needs no case of its own.**
  **THE SAME TWO STORES THE RESOLVER ASKS**, so a bench and the roof of a moving car are one
  question with one answer.
  **HOW MUCH RAIL IS LEFT IS MEASURED FROM THE BOX'S CENTRE, NOT FROM WHERE HE LANDED.** He
  catches it wherever he happens to be, so `|railS| > half` gives him a full half-length in
  BOTH directions from a catch near one end -- and runs him off the metal into thin air. `s0`
  is where the catch point sits along the edge and the limit is against the sum.
  **CATCHING IS DELIBERATE AND IT COSTS NO CONTROL.** A tap of the right pad IN THE AIR -- the
  same tap that ollies on the road, so there is no new gesture and which it is comes out of
  where he is. **AND RIDING PAST A RAIL MUST NEVER SNAG HIM**, which is what `align` is: the
  catch has to be roughly ALONG the edge, and he rides the way he was already going rather than
  being turned round onto the line.
  **THAT AIR TAP WAS A LATENT BUG SINCE m150.** `p.jump` is set by the pad and was only ever
  read in the grounded branch, so a tap in mid-air sat there and ollied him the instant he
  touched down. It is spent either way now.
  **THE GRIND OWNS THE BODY AND RETURNS**, above the ground test and above the collider: he is
  locked to a line, so gravity, the resolver and the ground snap have nothing to say. Same
  shape as cover and the ledge.
  **AND AN OLLIE OUT IS THE ONE PART THAT HAS TO FEEL DELIBERATE** -- leaving on a tap pops,
  running out of rail does not.
  **`p.pos.y` IS WHERE THE WHEELS ARE, ON THE GROUND AND ON A RAIL ALIKE**, which is why
  `boardPose` needed no special case: my first version overrode the deck's height on a rail and
  that was a SECOND answer to a question the generic line already gets right.
  **NO GRIND CLIP EXISTS**: `skate_idol_crouch` stands in, because it is the only board pose
  with his knees bent and it reads far better on a rail than the ollie hang does. Same stand-in
  rule as the ladder and the hang.
  **NOT DONE: RAMPS**, which he asked for and deferred himself. Worth knowing before it starts:
  Shredworld's ramps are a GLB whose triangles go into the same collider as the roads, so a
  ramp is a floor he rolls up rather than a box he stops against -- and melee's triangle store
  (`TRI`) exists only in Weirdport, where the test site has boxes alone. So a ramp is either a
  Weirdport-only asset or `TRI` has to be built in the test site too, and that choice is the
  first thing to settle. Also: no bail, no fakie, no half cab.

- **THE VEER WAS APPLIED AND THEN UNDONE EVERY FRAME, AND THE TRICKS (m152).** *"The diagonal
  hit isn't diagonal enough, it still points you in front of the vehicle. Also I can't do the
  tricks -- I was thinking of having that functionality when you're on the board."*
  **`pushCars` WAS DELETING THE LAUNCH.** m151 threw him 40 degrees off the lane and it made
  almost no difference, because the resolver runs EVERY SUBSTEP: the car is doing 9.5 m/s and
  he is decelerating out of a 12 m/s launch, so they stay in contact -- and each of those
  frames shoved him back out along the NOSE NORMAL, which is straight down the lane. **A
  resolver pushing a body mid-launch deletes the launch**, and no amount of angle survives it.
  That is m119's "one writer" in another shape: the launch and the push-out were both writing
  where he goes, and the one that runs sixty times a second won.
  **AIRBORNE ONLY, WHICH IS THE PART THAT KEEPS IT HONEST.** Down on the road a car still shoves
  him aside rather than driving through him; what is skipped is exactly the window he is over
  the bonnet in -- which is also the one he wants a tumble clip for.
  **AND THE ANGLE WENT TO 54 DEGREES** with it: sin(54) x 9 m is 7.3 m sideways against 5.3
  forward, so he LEAVES the carriageway rather than being sent up it. Both were wrong and only
  one of them was the number.
- **THE TRICKS COST NO CONTROL, BECAUSE BOTH FLICKS ARE FREE ON A BOARD (m152, `SK8.trick`,
  `boardFlick`, `trickStep`).** The right pad's flick is a strike and the left pad's is a dodge
  roll, and neither means anything while riding -- so the map is unchanged: **LEFT is the BODY
  (front flip, back flip) and RIGHT is the VERB (what the deck does).** Air only, which is
  Shredworld's rule and is what leaves the ground gestures alone.
  **A BOARD TRICK IS PURE GEOMETRY AND NO CLIP.** The deck runs along local Z, so with Euler
  `YXZ`: `rotation.z` is the kickflip axis, `rotation.y` the shove, `rotation.x` a body flip
  carrying the board round. **The length being on Z is not negotiable** -- a board whose long
  axis came in on X kickflips end over end -- which is why `buildBoard` gives one a quarter turn
  if it arrives the other way, a line there rather than a rewrite here.
  **`bRoll`/`bYaw` ARE RADIANS REMAINING AND `bRollA`/`bYawA` WHAT HAS BEEN APPLIED**, so the
  pose is a running total and "did he land it" is just how much is left. **Wrap the applied pair
  on landing** or a landed 360 visibly settles back through a whole turn on the road.
  **AND THE BANK AND THE KICKFLIP SHARE `rotation.z` ON PURPOSE** -- a board leaning into a
  kickflip is what a kickflip looks like.
  **THE TRICK FILLS THE JUMP.** An ollie is about 0.94 s of air and `back_flip` is 1.73 s of
  clip, so at 1x it could never once be landed; the duration comes from the BALLISTICS at the
  moment of the flick. **And the rate is clamped FIRST and the state's length derived back out
  of it** -- m8's landmine, and the floor on the air is 0.25 s, which unclamped is **x6.9**.
  **`front_flip` AND `back_flip` CAME OVER WITH THE SKATE SET**, and `back_flip`'s first 12
  frames are a CROUCH AND A PUSH OFF THE FLOOR -- it is authored as a STANDING flip, and played
  in mid-air that is a man crouching on nothing before he goes over. Shredworld cuts it with a
  runtime `TRIM`; here there is no such machinery and no reason for one, so `tools/skate.mjs`
  takes the head off the KEYS. **Delete that entry the moment an export bakes the cut in**, or
  it is taken twice. **And the trim is in the accessor DEDUPE KEY**: twelve distinct time
  accessors back 540 samplers in that file, so a cut applied to a shared array without the key
  would trim every clip that happens to be the same length -- the `times` landmine one level up,
  where the fix is to clone and here the fix is not to share.
  **A DECK TRICK DOES NOT OWN THE POSE AND A BODY FLIP DOES.** A kickflip is the BOARD turning
  under a man holding the ordinary air pose, which is what it is.

- **THE LAUNCH WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE LANE, BECAUSE THE CONTACT NORMAL WAS RIGHT (m151,
  `CARHIT.veer`).** *"It pushes you perfectly forward in front of it so it just knocks you down
  and then it keeps hitting you over and over. It should shoot you off forward, but at an angle
  so that you clear the trajectory of the car. Hit me like 10 times."*
  **m149's NORMAL IS CORRECT AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY.** On a nose the contact normal IS the
  car's own heading, so `dirH` put him back down the middle of the lane he was hit in -- and
  `HURT.back` carries him about 9 m, which at 9.5 m/s the car covers in under a second. A
  knock-down runs about 2.5 s, `c.hitT` is 0.9, so the same car could hit him three times before
  he was on his feet and the car behind it could start again. **Ten is not an exaggeration.**
  **THE VEER IS 40 DEGREES AND THE NUMBER IS SIZED, NOT PICKED**: sin(40) x 9 m is **5.8 m** of
  sideways travel, against a lane offset of 3.2 m and a road about 11 m wide, so he lands off
  the carriageway he was hit in rather than merely further along it.
  **AND THE SIGN IS DERIVED, BECAUSE THIS FILE GETS HANDEDNESS BACKWARDS HALF THE TIME WHEN IT
  ARGUES.** `boxLocal` writes `o.z = dot(d, (-sn, cs))`, so a positive `lat` puts him in the
  world direction `(-sn, cs)`. The nose heading has `(sin h0, cos h0) = (cs, sn)`, and solving
  `(sin h, cos h) = (-sn, cs)` gives `h0 - PI/2` -- so the side he is ALREADY ON is a LOWER
  heading and the veer is the NEGATIVE of `sign(lat)`. Backwards, he is thrown across the
  bonnet, which is the bug rather than the fix.
  **DEAD CENTRE THE OFFSET IS NOISE AND ITS SIGN IS ROUNDING**, `copFly`'s own rule, so under a
  tenth of a metre it falls back to the way he is already moving across the lane.
  **AND IT IS THE LAUNCH ONLY.** A graze already shoves him out of the way and turning that
  sideways is a push that does not read as the car that gave it.
  **PLUS: A MAN ALREADY ON THE FLOOR IS NOT HIT AGAIN.** Shredworld's rule is that being punted
  along by the next car in the queue is the thing he asked for; he has asked for the opposite
  here in the same breath, and he is the judge. One blow per knock-down, and he is fair game
  the moment he is on his feet. `mel.CARHIT.veer = 0` is m149 exactly.
  **STILL NOT DRAWN: going over the top.** *"Maybe I'll eventually put in some roll animation
  so you kind of tumble over the top of the car."* That is a clip and `HURT.down` is the one
  string it goes in; nothing here has to change for it. Raising the arc to clear the roof is
  NOT free, though, and it is worth writing down why: m96 solves the fall clip's playback rate
  from `2*vy/g` so the pose is on the floor before he is, so a car that launches higher than a
  mace needs that solve to see its own `vy` rather than `HURT.hi`'s.

- **THE SKATEBOARD, AND THE TWO RIGS TURNED OUT TO BE THE SAME RIG (m150, `SK8`, `buildBoard`,
  `stepSkate`, `boardPose`, `tools/skate.mjs`).** *"It would be cool to import the skateboard
  and the skate animations from Shredworld until I can make new ones, and make it so we can
  skateboard around."*
  **THE GO/NO-GO WAS ONE MEASUREMENT AND IT CAME BACK BETTER THAN EXPECTED.** Colin's 68 joints
  against zap's 62, read straight out of both files' JSON chunks (node transforms are never
  draco, so this needs no decoder):
      SHARED 59 joints    rest-pose offset mean **0.06 deg**, worst 3.00 on `weapon_tip`
      over 5 deg          **NONE**
      Hips                0.02 deg, and BOTH are `Armature[0.01] > root > Hips`
      the 9 zap lacks     four thumbs a side, plus Colin's `weapon_root`
  So there is no per-bone delta to apply, no `HIPFIX` family rotation, and **no runtime
  retarget at all** -- which is Shredworld's own `ownClips` rule: a track filter and a hips
  correction exist to survive wearing ANOTHER skeleton's animation, and neither means anything
  here. The pool is appended raw.
  **WHAT DOES DIFFER IS HOW BIG THE TWO MEN ARE**, and that is one number: Colin's hips sit at
  52.830 armature units and zap's at 40.078, **k = 0.7586**. The HIPS TRANSLATION is the body's
  height off the ground and every crouch, push and landing in the set uses it, so it is
  re-expressed OFFLINE by `tools/skate.mjs` in `retarget`'s own form, `p' = restT + k*(p -
  restS)` -- exact at the bind pose by construction. **A scaled ABSOLUTE (`k*p`) is the version
  that looks right and is not**: it also scales wherever the artist put the pelvis relative to
  the armature origin, which is a free choice per export and was 11.5 units of it at m119.
  **THE EXTRACTOR IS A GLB WITH NO MESH, NO SKIN AND NO MATERIAL** -- a node tree and seven
  animations, which is all `gltf.animations` needs. 10.2 MB in, **264 KB out**. Every scale
  track and every non-Hips position track is dropped (a bone's translation is its LENGTH), and
  so are the thumb tracks: a track whose target is not in the scene is a console warning per
  clip per load, and nobody sees a thumb curl on a skateboard.
  **AND `normaliseClips` IS NOT OPTIONAL ON IT.** `npm run clips` reads **ten distinct time
  accessors across 420 samplers** in that file, which is the shared-`times` landmine exactly: a
  shift applied per track subtracts from one array dozens of times, the duration comes back
  negative, and every clip freezes on its last frame for ever.
  **ALL SEVEN CLIPS ARE DISTINCT**, checked rather than assumed -- `npm run clips` prints the
  same duration and moving-bone count for `skate_idol_standing`, `skate_ollie_air` and
  `skate_ollie_init_air` because they share a time accessor and have similar upper-body motion,
  and their full channel signatures are 7 of 7 distinct.
  **IT IS A KIT SLOT, WHICH IS SHREDWORLD'S OWN ANSWER.** A board is a whole locomotion mode and
  keeps its own code path -- but what is in your hands is exactly what the kit is for, and a
  second control would be a second thing on a HUD he has twice asked to have less on. **`p.board`
  is DERIVED from the slot** (`boardOut()`), never stored, so a knock-down, a disguise or a swap
  takes the deck away and there is nothing to put back: `KIT.on`'s three-owners bug, avoided by
  never writing it down.
  **EVERY NUMBER ABOUT THE DECK IS MEASURED AND ONE IS TYPED.** `SK8.len` is how long a
  skateboard is; the scale comes off the model's own long horizontal axis and the deck height
  off the **area-weighted centre of every up-facing triangle**, which on a board is the flat of
  the grip. The bounding-box top is the KICKTAILS and standing him on those puts him three
  centimetres in the air. **And the long axis must end up on local Z**, because that is what the
  yaw and the bank are written against.
  **THE GRADE IS SAMPLED, BECAUSE `groundAt` RETURNS A HEIGHT AND NOT A NORMAL.** Two probes
  `SK8.probe` apart along the way he points is the rise over the run, which is all a slope term
  needs -- and it works in BOTH worlds, where reading a triangle's normal would only work in the
  one that has triangles.
  **THE WHEELS ARE WHAT STEER, SO THE HEADING TURNS AND THE VELOCITY IS REBUILT ON IT** -- and
  the rebuild has to use the NEW heading. My first version took `fx`/`fz` at the top of the
  frame, before the steer, so the deck turned under a line that never changed and the carve did
  nothing. In the AIR the heading turns and the velocity does NOT, which is the only thing that
  makes landing sideways mean anything.
  **THE PUSH CYCLE IS A PHASE IN [0,1), NEVER RAW SECONDS**, because the period moves with speed
  and `T / P(now)` and the integral of `dt / P(t)` are the same number only while P is constant.
  The stroke is spread over `shoveDur` on a half sine whose integral is exactly 1, so the shape
  costs nothing in top speed; the scrape fires at `plant`, the point in the cycle the foot is
  actually on the road. **And the CLIP is seeked to that phase once a cycle, never every frame**
  -- `skinWeights` rewinds an action the moment its damped weight leaves the floor, which
  happens again every time the crouch swaps which of the two push clips is up.
  **THE PUSH CLIP IS WEIGHTED BY WHETHER HE IS PUSHING, NOT BY THE STROKE.** Weighting it by
  `shoveT` shows 0.4 s of a 1.45 s cycle, which is a fragment of an animation rather than an
  animation.
  **HE STANDS ON THE DECK AND HIS COLLIDER DOES NOT.** `rig.root` is lifted by the measured deck
  height; the body stays on the ground, which is right -- the board is a picture and the man is
  the body.
  **AND `stepFeet` HAD TO LEARN ABOUT IT.** It is the first line of `stepPlayer`, above the
  branch that owns the body, so without `p.board` in its list he would have had a walk cycle's
  footsteps under a board -- m70's exact finding, one state along, and the push has its own.
  **`boardPose` RUNS AFTER `stepPlayer`**, because the deck is drawn where he ENDED UP: read
  before it, the board trails the man standing on it by a frame, which at 13 m/s is 22 cm.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** no harness here can build a skin, so **whether he stands on
  the deck rather than through it, whether the clips read at all on his proportions, and whether
  13 m/s is fun in a test site of ten boxes are device questions.** What was checked: the rigs
  agree, the extracted file parses through the REAL vendored loader with 7 clips and 420 tracks,
  and both gates pass in both worlds. The chip carries `SK8 <speed>` / `SK8 off` / `NO BOARD`,
  because "it never loaded", "the slot is not out" and "I am on it and it is wrong" are three
  bugs and one picture from a phone.
  **NOT DONE, AND EACH ITS OWN BUILD:** tricks, grinds and rails, a bail, fakie and the half
  cab -- Shredworld has all six worked out. And **riding-and-shooting**, which is c113's
  independent slots plus c115's `__up`/`__legs` override and is the biggest of them.

- **A CAR IS A BLOW ALONG THE CONTACT NORMAL, AND ONLY A NOSE CAN LAUNCH HIM (m149, `CARHIT`,
  `carHit`).** *"Can we make the cars hit you and send you flying? And land land down and get
  up."*
  **THE LAND AND THE GET-UP NEEDED NOT ONE LINE.** `playerHurt`'s knock-down is the single path
  a mace, a plasma bolt and now a bonnet all take: it rolls the arc, SOLVES the fall clip's rate
  so the pose is on the floor before he is (m96), runs the get-up, and cancels whatever move
  owned the body. So this build is the SCORE and nothing else -- which is the return on m67 and
  m96 having been built as a knock-down rather than as a mace reaction.
  **AND THE CONTACT NORMAL IS NOT RE-DERIVED.** `pushCars` already picks the face he is least
  deep into -- nose or flank -- and rotates it out of the car's own frame, so the face he is
  shoved out of IS the face he is thrown off, by construction. Recovering a bearing from the
  geometry of a contact where the two things are on top of each other is `copFly`'s mistake,
  and this avoids it by never asking the question.
  **`w` IS THE CAR'S SPEED ALONG THAT NORMAL, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF "ONLY A NOSE".** On a flank
  the normal is perpendicular to the way the car is going, so a side-swipe scores near zero
  however fast it is -- no case, no test, it falls out of the dot product.
  **AND THE SCORE IS NOT EITHER SPEED ON ITS OWN.** Being hit is not the same event as running
  into something, so his own approach counts for `mine` .45 of the car's. Tabled:
      car at cruise, nose on, he is standing     close 9.50  s 1.00  KNOCK, 26 dmg
      car at cruise, FLANK                       close 0.00         nothing
      he sprints into a PARKED flank at 7.2      close 3.24  s 0.09  a bump, 7 dmg
      he sprints into an oncoming nose           close 12.7  s 1.00  KNOCK
      car crawling out of a junction at 2.0      close 2.00         nothing (`v` 2.6)
  **`ref` IS `TRAF.cruise`**, so a car at its own cruising speed is a full hit by construction
  rather than by a number picked to match it -- retune the traffic and this follows.
  **AND `cool` IS PER CAR, NOT PER FRAME.** `pushCars` runs inside the substep loop up to
  `MOVE.subMax` times, so without it one contact is a dozen blows. Being punted along the road
  by the NEXT car in the queue is deliberate and is what `HURT.again` bounds.
  **A GUARD STILL BLUNTS ONE**, because it goes through `playerHurt` like everything else. That
  is stated rather than hidden: blocking a car is silly, and it is also a deliberate act with
  the thumb held down in an odd place, so it is left alone rather than paid for with a seventh
  argument on a function six callers already share.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** every Weirdport GLB rejects headless, so `stepTraffic` has
  never built a car outside a browser and nothing here can drive the resolver against one.
  Whether 26 damage is too much of a 100 hp bar, and whether the launch reads as a car hit
  rather than as a punch, are device questions. `mel.CARHIT` is live and `mel.CARHIT.on = 0`
  is the one word back to m148.

- **A KEYFRAME TRACK'S `times` ARRAY IS SHARED, AND MUTATING IT IN PLACE IS THE WORST BUG THIS
  CLASS OF FILE HAS.** This export has **4,464 samplers referencing 33 distinct time accessors**
  — `npm run clips` prints that ratio and flags it. GLTFLoader resolves each accessor once and
  caches it, and `KeyframeTrack` keeps the `Float32Array` **by reference**. So shifting "each
  track's" times to remove the start offset subtracts it from the same array about a hundred and
  thirty times: the times go deeply negative, `resetDuration()` comes back NEGATIVE, and a track
  evaluated past its last key returns that key — **every clip in the file frozen on its final
  frame, for ever.** It reads as "he just holds the pose", and weights, loop modes and playback
  rates are all fine and all irrelevant. `normaliseClips` does
  `t.times = Float32Array.from(t.times)` before touching anything, and a clip whose duration
  comes back non-positive says so rather than going quiet.
- **EVERY CLIP STARTS AT 1/24 s**, which is one held frame at the top of every loop — 8% of a
  0.5 s run cycle spent standing still. Shifted to zero (see above for how, carefully).
- **THE REDUNDANT TRACKS ARE SAFE TO STRIP AND THAT WAS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED.** All 62 scale
  tracks in all 23 clips hold their rest value to within 5.4e-7, and every position track except
  the Hips holds its rest value to within 2.3e-5 armature units. So stripping them is a no-op
  that removes ~2,700 channels of work per frame. **The Hips translation STAYS** — it is the
  body's height off the ground, and every crouch, landing and roll in this set uses it. If a
  future export animates a finger's position or a bone's scale on purpose, `npm run clips` says
  so and those two filters are what to revisit.
- **A SCALE TRACK PINNED AT ZERO IS NOT A TRACK THAT "DOES NOT MOVE".** A metric that asks
  whether a track CHANGES reports a bone collapsed to a point as fine. Read VALUES, not deltas,
  when the question is "is this track sane". None of this file's are — checked.
- **A QUATERNION COMPONENT DELTA IS NOT A ROTATION.** `q` and `−q` are the same rotation, so a
  component swinging −1 → +1 reads as a delta of 2 and is a sign flip the interpolant takes the
  short way round. Measuring components makes a six-frame stride and a static clip look
  identical. The honest number is `2·acos(|dot|)`.
- **NEVER ASK `action.isRunning()` WHETHER A CLIP STILL MATTERS — ASK ITS WEIGHT.** three ends a
  `LoopOnce` clip with `clampWhenFinished ? paused = true : enabled = false`, and `isRunning()`
  is `enabled && !paused`, so every clip in `ONCE` is *not running* from the instant it
  finishes. A clip shut down inside `else if (a.isRunning())` therefore keeps the 1.0 it was
  last given and goes on applying its final frame for the rest of the session — a landing pose
  welded into the walk.
- **AND RE-ENTERING A `ONCE` CLIP HAS TO REWIND IT, ON THE STATE AND NOT ON THE DAMPED WEIGHT.**
  Rewinding only once the weight has decayed is right for a clip you left alone and wrong for
  one you are re-entering immediately: roll, roll again before the first has faded, and the
  action is still PAUSED on its last frame — which on a roll is a forward step. `playOnce` is
  called BY the state that starts the clip. That is the same landmine as the one above wearing
  its other face: a paused action is indistinguishable from a live one from outside.
- **THE TARGET WEIGHTS MUST SUM TO 1.** A zero-weight bone is blended back to its BIND value by
  the mixer, which is the **T-pose exactly**, so a table that dips below 1 mid-crossfade bleeds
  the bind pose in and one missing clip name is enough to do it. `setWeights` falls back to the
  idle and the clip table is checked against the file at load, with anything absent named in the
  chip rather than failing silently.
- **ANIMATION IS WEIGHTS, NOT CROSSFADES.** `rigAnim` asks for a set of clip weights each frame
  and `setWeights` damps toward it. A `crossFadeFrom` state machine has to know what it is
  coming *from*, which breaks the first time two transitions overlap — and they always
  eventually overlap.
- **A GAIT IS A BLEND BY MEASURED SPEED, NEVER A RUN FLAG**, and every reference speed in `GAIT`
  is measured by `npm run gait` rather than eyeballed. It reads the speed the **planted foot**
  slides backwards at in the body frame, which is exactly the speed the clip is walking at, with
  no assumption about stride length, double support or float time. At ×1.926:
  walk 0.84, run 3.09, sprint 4.55, back 2.23, strafe ~2.0, aim-run 3.36 m/s.
  **`MOVE.max` is the sprint's own speed** so the fastest clip plays at 1.0× at full tilt and
  the feet never slide at the top of the range.
  **THE TOOL'S FIRST VERSION WAS WRONG AND SAID SO ITSELF:** it gated stance on the foot moving
  backwards in +Z, which is right for a run and exactly wrong for a backpedal (the stance foot
  slides FORWARD) and for a strafe (sideways). Both came back with the two feet disagreeing by
  34% and 44% — the check catching the tool rather than the asset. The direction is DERIVED per
  foot now, and the `travel` column reads +6° for the walk, −172° for the backpedal and +87° for
  the left strafe, which is the measurement describing itself.
  **`run_fwd_fast`'s two feet still disagree by 34%** (L 2.77, R 1.96). That is a real asymmetry
  in the clip, reported rather than hidden. If the sprint ever reads limpy, that is why.
- **A GAIT BAND IS READ AGAINST THE STICK, NOT AGAINST THE SPEED RANGE (m27).** *"I was trying
  to go really slow to make him do his walk and he was basically doing a slow run -- half
  stride. And I don't think I ever see the fast run."* Both are the same table, and the
  arithmetic says it outright. `MOVE.max` is 7.2 and the pad curve is `mag^1.4`, so the
  deflection that asks for a speed is `.12 + (sp/7.2)^(1/1.4) * .88`:
      walkAt .30    ->  21% of the stick. INSIDE the noise of a thumb, so the walk was
                        unreachable and everything holdable landed in the crossfade.
      at 36%        ->  walk .64 / run .36, walk pushed to 1.37x and run CLAMPED at tsLo .55
                        -- a fast walk averaged with a slow-motion run. That IS the half stride.
      sprintAt 5.00 ->  85% of the stick before `run_fwd_fast` is ever pure.
  **Bands are chosen by where they land on the PAD.** Re-cut so each clip owns a stretch and the
  crossfades are short: idle 0-25%, walk 25-38%, run ~55%, sprint 76%+.
  **And no amount of blending fixes two clips both playing at the wrong rate.** walk 0.84 and
  run 3.09 are **3.7x apart with nothing authored between them**, so in the middle each is off
  by ~1.9x whatever you do -- the only real fix is to spend as little of the stick in there as
  possible. **A jog clip is what would close it properly.**
  **The weights are a CHAIN so they sum to exactly 1** (`A`, `A(1-B)`, `AB(1-C)`, `ABC`), with
  `idleAt` its own edge rather than sharing `walkAt` -- that is what lets the walk own real pad
  while the idle still lets go promptly. A table that dips below 1 mid-crossfade bleeds the BIND
  pose in, which is the T-pose exactly.
  **`tsHi` came down 1.9 -> 1.6**: at 1.9 the walk clip is a cartoon scramble for the whole
  crossfade.
- **ONE SOUND FOR ONE EVENT (m27).** *"I think it's playing two sounds for the charge -- there's
  a waaaaa which is good and then an electrical zap I don't need."* Exactly two voices on one
  event: `chargeStart`'s synth hum, which rises for as long as the trigger is held and IS the
  charge, and a one-shot `zap` fired beside it. m26 capped the zap's length, which made it
  shorter and no less redundant -- **the fix for a duplicate is not a quieter duplicate.** The
  sample is still loaded and `mel.snd('zap')` still plays it; nothing in the blaster asks for it.
- **A FLOOR MEANT FOR ONE THING MUST NOT BE SHARED WITH ANOTHER (m27, `chargeGoH`).** The
  charged leap's APEX was scaled by `chargeGoK`, whose floor is `MELEE.finishMin` .45 -- so the
  shortest real swing already jumped 45% as high as the longest and the hold bought almost
  nothing you could see. That floor exists because a half-charge swing still has to LAND, which
  is about power and reach; how HIGH he goes has no such floor and wants the whole range. Its
  own curve (`finishHiK0` .30 to 1), and the apex doubled at the top: 4.6 m on top of him at a
  full charge against 1.4 for a bare release.
- **`idle_01` READS 0.002 m/s AND THAT IS THE CONTROL.** A measurement with no case that must
  come back zero is a measurement nobody can trust.
- **THE CLIPS ANIMATE IN PLACE.** The `root` bone carries 0.03° of noise and no translation at
  all, so locomotion is entirely code-driven. Do not go looking for root motion.
- **THE MOUNT MARKERS ARE INERT IN EVERY CLIP** — checked, not assumed: no marker deviates from
  its rest pose by more than 0.5° anywhere in the file. That matters because **a mount marker's
  rest pose IS the placement**, so a clip that moves one is the weapon moving inside his fist —
  and keying a marker's position in ONE clip writes that pose into every other clip's rest
  fallback, because a channel a clip does not key is left at the node's rest value. `npm run
  clips` flags any marker that starts moving.
- **THE ARMATURE SCALE IS APPLIED TWICE IF YOU CLONE THE WHOLE WEAPON SCENE.** A weapon file is
  `Armature(0.01) > weapon_root_right > mesh`, and the character's mount is ALREADY inside his
  own `Armature(0.01)` — so a naive clone onto the joint comes out at a hundredth of its size,
  which from a phone is indistinguishable from the file never having loaded. `mountWeapon` takes
  only what sits BELOW the file's own mount, with the mesh's transform relative to that mount
  preserved. **And the chip says the size in centimetres**, because "it doesn't show up" is
  three bugs wearing one face — never loaded, loaded at 1/100, or right size and wrong place —
  and only a number tells them apart.
- **A `skins` BLOCK IS NOT A SKINNED MESH.** Both weapon files have one, and neither mesh
  references it (no `JOINTS_0`, no `skin` on the node): Blender writes the armature out beside a
  mesh that is merely PARENTED to it. **The reference ON THE MESH is the fact.** These are rigid
  parents, correctly.
- **MEASURE HIM WITH GEOMETRY BOUNDS, NEVER `Box3.setFromObject`.** A skinned mesh ignores its
  node transform but `setFromObject` applies it anyway — and this armature is scaled 0.01, so
  the box comes back a hundredth of his size. GLTFLoader binds every skin with the IDENTITY
  matrix, so at rest a vertex's geometry position IS its world position and the bounds are
  already metres.
- **A STUCK STICK IS ALWAYS A MISSING `pointerup`**, and there are four ways one goes missing on
  a phone: a second finger on the same pad overwriting the pad's `id`; `setPointerCapture`
  throwing after the pointer has already gone (and it was called AFTER `id` was set, so the
  throw left the pad tracking a dead id); capture lost without `lostpointercapture` reaching us;
  and the app backgrounded mid-touch, which delivers nothing on the way out or back and is the
  one that leaves a stick parked at full deflection with no finger near it. All four are closed.
- **THERE IS NO STICK WATCHDOG AND THERE MUST NOT BE.** A pointer that is not moving generates
  no events, so "no events" and "no thumb" are the same observation and no amount of waiting
  separates them; the browser has no "is this pointer still down" to ask. A test that cannot
  tell its two answers apart is not a test, and its false positive — dropping a hold the player
  is in the middle of, which is what running in a straight line IS — is worse than the bug.
- **A FLICK IS A FAST MOVE *AND THEN A RELEASE*, AND BOTH HALVES ARE THE GATE.** Judged on
  `pointerup` alone it is dead on a pad that is already being held: the time since `pointerdown`
  is always past any window, so the gesture can never once fire. Judged on the pad's own travel
  alone it fires MID-HOLD — every fast correction of a steering thumb is a trick, and a
  press-and-hold cannot be told from a swipe at all. So the TRAVEL arms it and the LIFT fires
  it, if the lift comes inside `FLICK.let` **of the travel, never of the pointerdown**. The
  history is seeded at the CENTRE on pointerdown, because on an absolute pad a thumb slammed
  onto the top edge IS a flick and a delta from where it landed says the stick never moved.
- **`touch-action` IS NOT THE FIX FOR DOUBLE-TAP ZOOM.** iOS Safari has ignored
  `user-scalable=no` since iOS 10 and decides that gesture off the touch stream, so the touch
  stream is where it is refused: the second `touchend` within 400 ms **and** 40 px is cancelled,
  with real controls exempt (cancelling there kills their synthesised click, and Safari does not
  zoom on a target it already treats as interactive). Pinch is a separate non-standard event
  family — `gesturestart`/`gesturechange`/`gestureend` — dispatched AT the element, so those are
  listened for with **capture**, on document as well as window.
- **THE CRASH TRAP IS THE FIRST THING IN THE HEAD**, before the import map and before the
  module, registered with CAPTURE so a subresource that 404s is caught too — that includes a
  module that fails to PARSE and an import that never resolves. A phone has no console, so an
  exception is otherwise a blank screen. It is `z-index: 999`, monospaced and **selectable**, so
  the message can be copied or read out. Both head scripts are plain scripts, not modules: a
  guard that installs when the game finishes loading is absent for the whole of the loading
  screen and absent entirely if the module throws, which is exactly when it is needed.
- **THE BOOT CARD SPEAKS WHEN A LOAD *STARTS*, NOT FROM THE PROGRESS CALLBACK.** `e.total` is
  the `Content-Length`: a response served without one — chunked, which is what a CDN does to a
  big file often enough — produces **no progress call at all** for that whole file, so the card
  keeps whatever text it had. For the first load that is the text it was BORN with, which is
  pixel for pixel what `init()` never running looks like. The two failures most worth telling
  apart were rendering as the same screen.
- **NEVER SCRUB A VELOCITY WITH A BARE `*= k` PER FRAME** — `Math.exp(-k*dt)` or `damp`, always,
  or the half-life depends on the frame rate and a 120 Hz phone plays a different game.
- **SPEEDING UP IS RAMPED; SLOWING DOWN IS NOT.** `accFall` is about how fast he can pick speed
  UP, and slowing down is not accelerating — one sign test. Without it a body carrying speed out
  of a lunge takes many seconds to come back to a walk, which reads as ice.
  **And `accFall` measures against the speed he is ACTUALLY being asked for**, not a fixed
  ceiling: against a fixed one it pins the acceleration at its floor the moment he passes that
  ceiling, so a raised target can never be reached and raising it reads as doing nothing at all.
- **LOCOMOTION IS THREE SEPARATE IDEAS AND THE MOONWALK IS MISSING THE THIRD.** (1) the gather
  lives in `push`, not in the target speed; (2) `heading` is the thumb taken instantly while
  `faceH` is the BODY coming round at `face0`/`face1`, and he is DRAWN at `faceH`; (3) **`plant`**
  — at a walk the legs push where the thumb says, at a run along `faceH`. Without (3) the
  velocity keeps answering the stick while the body has already turned, which *is* the moonwalk.
  `turnBrake` costs him speed through a hard turn, which is what plants the feet rather than
  just pointing them.
- **ONE WRITER ON `cam.az`, ALWAYS.** The right pad drags it and nothing else does; while aiming
  he simply faces wherever the lens is pointed, which is the same number rather than a second
  one to keep in step. Two writers on a camera bearing is a loop that never settles and a
  picture that shakes, and it shows up every single time.
  **AND THE PRICE OF THAT INVARIANT IS THAT THE CAMERA'S SENSITIVITY IS THE AIM'S** — see
  `CAM.deadAim`. It is worth paying; it is not free, and a dead zone is where it gets paid.
- **THE CAMERA COMES IN WHEN SOMETHING IS IN THE WAY, IT DOES NOT CLIMB OVER IT.** Shortening
  the boom keeps the SHOT — a level three-quarter view — while lifting the lens turns it into a
  top-down one, which is a different and much worse shot. **Snap in, ease out:** easing IN is
  time spent inside the wall. And the probe **bisects**: walking in fixed steps and returning
  the last clear one means the answer only ever takes values `probe` apart, so the boom jumps
  half a metre at a time as the shot sways past a wall. A quantised probe is fine for a yes/no
  and wrong the moment something continuous is drawn from it.
- **AN OVERRIDE SPLIT IS ONLY VALID IF BOTH HALVES SHARE A FRAME, AND THE STANCE TURN IS IN THE
  HIPS (m19).** *"As soon as you press left or right he's facing 90 degrees the wrong direction...
  and the blaster aiming is still just very wrong."* One fact, and it is measurable straight off
  the clips -- every one of these poses is a BLADED body, and the turn that blades it lives in the
  Hips rather than in the spine:
      shoot                hips yawed -61.7 deg   barrel -18.3 off his nose
      rifle_run            hips        -34.6      barrel  +0.7  -- dead straight
      weapon_melee_charge  hips        -74.5      (the sideways wind-up, and it reads RIGHT)
      strafe_left / right  hips        -13.6 / +3.4
  Every spine-up track in `shoot` is authored to sit on a hips at -61.7. The split sent the Hips
  DOWN with the legs, so it arrived at the strafe's -13.6 instead -- and the whole upper body,
  gun included, came out **48 degrees round**, the melee charge 61. Standing still (the whole
  clip, no split) it was right; the first step sideways swung it. That is both halves of his
  report and it is one line.
  **The hips ROTATION is the stance and goes UP with the pose built on it; the hips TRANSLATION
  is the body's height and the stride's bounce and stays with the LEGS.** So the filter is on the
  TRACK, not on the bone name -- `isUpper('mixamorig_Hips.quaternion')` is true and
  `...Hips.position` is false. The legs are children of the hips and come round with the blade,
  which is what a bladed stance strafing actually looks like.
- **A PER-BONE EDIT WHOSE OWN EFFECT FEEDS THE THING THAT MEASURES IT HAS NO VERSION THAT IS
  SIMPLY RIGHT (m19).** The spine twist that pointed the gun at the mark was wrong four separate
  ways and is gone. m16 read the parent frame off a SCALED `matrixWorld` (below) so the
  conjugation was a shear and it hunched him. m17 fixed that, and the integrator promptly wound
  up to its own clamp and parked there -- `aimUntwist` + `mixer.update` wipe the edit before
  `barrelH` measures again, so it never once saw its own output. m18 solved it in closed form and
  it STILL swung, because three's world matrices are a frame stale at that point and the reading
  carried the previous frame's correction after all: *"his gun starts out pointing to the right
  and he moves it across his chest all the way to the left."* Every fix was real and every one
  uncovered the next.
  **THE BODY TURNS, NOT THE SPINE.** How far a pose holds the weapon off his nose is a RIGID
  property of that pose, so undoing it is a rigid yaw on the ROOT: one number, no conjugation, no
  bone to unravel, nothing to take off again before the mixer writes, and it cannot shear anything
  because a root yaw is the same turn every bone was already getting.
  **And it is measured with no loop in it.** `barrelH` returns a WORLD bearing and the comp is
  part of the root yaw that produced it, so subtracting the yaw THAT FRAME WAS DRAWN AT
  (`rig.drawnYaw`, stored where it is written) removes the comp exactly. The bias is invariant to
  the comp -- it is the pose's own offset and nothing else, which is the one thing an integrator
  on the spine could never be told.
  **It is gated on `gunOut()`, not on `committed()`**, because the hammer wind-up is a
  deliberately bladed stance he likes and straightening it would be the fix breaking the one pose
  that was right.
  **The chip carries `B<bias>/C<comp>`**: a bias near 0 means the clip is straight and anything
  crooked is elsewhere, a big one means the clip carries it. `mel.POSE.on = 0` turns the whole
  correction off so the raw authored pose can be looked at.
- **`setFromRotationMatrix` ASSUMES AN UNSCALED MATRIX, AND EVERY BONE HERE IS SCALED (m17).**
  *"He's not pointing straight and I'm pretty sure I made that animation straight."* He did. The
  clip was fine and the pipeline was bending him: `aimTwist` extracted the parent's world
  rotation with `TWISTP.setFromRotationMatrix(b.parent.matrixWorld)`, and three's own source
  says that method "assumes the upper 3x3 of m is a pure rotation matrix (i.e, unscaled)".
  These bones live under an `Armature` scaled **0.01** with the model scaled 1.926 on top, so
  that matrix carries a uniform scale of about 0.0193 — and the trace formula fed a scaled
  matrix returns a non-unit, wrong quaternion. The conjugation `P⁻¹ Q P` then stops being a yaw
  and becomes a SKEW: hunched over, gun swung off to the side, in a clip animated straight.
  **`getWorldQuaternion` decomposes and is the only safe way to read a bone's world rotation in
  this file.** Anything that reads a rotation off a `matrixWorld` here has the same bug waiting.
  **And the symptom pointed AWAY from the cause**, which is why it is worth writing down: a
  crooked gun reads as a clip problem or an aim-maths problem, and the hunched SPINE in the same
  screenshot is the tell — no aiming bug bends a man forward.
- **+X IS HIS LEFT.** Forward is `(sin h, cos h)` and his right is `(-fz, fx)`, so facing +Z his
  right is −X and a POSITIVE sine is a strafe to the LEFT. Written down because that argument
  comes out backwards about half the time, and the strafe clips are picked by its sign.
- **A STATE WHOSE LENGTH DISAGREES WITH THE CLIP IT IS PLAYING CAN ONLY EVER CUT THAT CLIP OFF
  (m8).** *"The roll landing is not playing all the way through."* Exactly right, and it was
  arithmetic: `p.land` was `.62` while the clip was scaled to play over `p.land * 1.9` = 1.18 s,
  so the hard landing's state ended with **more than half its clip still to run** and the gait
  took over mid-roll. Worse, the cancel window was `land * .45`, a QUARTER of the clip: one
  nudge of the stick and you never saw it at all. There is one number per landing now
  (`MOVE.landSoft` / `landHard`) and the clip is compressed to exactly it, so the two cannot
  drift apart again.
  **And the weight is held FULL until `landFree`, then given way.** Ramping it down from the
  first frame put the gait at 0.55 through the whole second half, which dilutes exactly the part
  of a hard landing worth watching.
- **HE LOOKED DARK, AND THE ANSWER IS NOT A BIGGER SUN (m8).** Winding the globals up far enough
  to fix a dark character blows out a near-white floor, and he then reads DARKER against it, not
  lighter. Three things instead, each doing a different job: his own base map fed back as
  **emission** (`RIG.emissive`, white `emissive` + `emissiveMap = map`, so what comes back is his
  own colours rather than a wash toward grey, and it lands after the lighting so it brightens
  without making him shiny); a **cool fill from the opposite side** casting nothing, which is
  what actually works on a shadow side; and only a small lift on the hemisphere and the sun,
  with the floor brought down a little to meet him.
- **WHICH HUE GLOWS IS MEASURED OFF THE TEXTURE, NOT PICKED BY EYE (m8).** *"Grab a colour ramp
  of the blaster and make the blueish colour glow, and see if there's a hue or tone on the alien
  to ramp the emission on as well."* So the texture is asked. It is a **saturation-weighted** hue
  histogram and the weighting is the part that matters: a character map is mostly midtones and
  skin, so counting every pixel equally reports the BACKGROUND rather than the accent. Weighted,
  it finds the blue trim on a grey blaster, because the grey has no chroma and does not vote.
  **The centroid is taken on the CIRCLE**, not on the bin index — hue wraps, and red is exactly
  the family that sits across the seam at zero.
  **ONE SHADER SERVES BOTH**, keyed on a hue band times saturation, so a grey or a white can
  never light up however the band is set. `mel.hues()` says what it found and `mel.glow(a, g)` /
  `mel.hue(a, g)` are the live A/B, because how much a colour should glow is a look-at-it
  decision and those belong on the phone.
  **AND THE CHIP CARRIES IT (`H<alien>/<gun>`)**, because there is no console on a phone and a
  measurement nobody can read is a measurement nobody can act on.
  **This cannot be checked offline**: the textures are WebP inside the GLB and there is no
  decoder in this container, so what the histogram will pick is a device question. That is why
  it reports itself.
- **THE BLASTER IS A CHARGE SHOT: THE HOLD WINDS IT UP AND THE RELEASE FIRES IT.** An
  auto-repeating firing loop was the first version and it is a different weapon — nothing about
  it rewards the hold, so the hold stops meaning anything and the reticle has nothing to
  converge over. **The release is the shot, which is why the pad's `onRel` must NOT clear
  `p.aim`**: `stepKit` fires on the edge where the trigger stops being held, so clearing the
  state in the handler would eat every shot in the game. Everything that ends a hold — letting
  go, rolling the thumb back down, sweeping off the arc, backgrounding the app — comes through
  that one edge.
  **And a fumble is not a shot** (`WEAP.minChg`): under a tenth of a charge the release fires
  nothing, or every stray brush of the top of the pad is a bolt.
- **THE RETICLE CONVERGES, AND IT IS ALL CSS.** Four layers of arc at four radii, each spinning
  at its own rate, all approaching scale 1 as the charge fills — so "how loaded is the shot" is
  a SHAPE rather than a bar, and it is legible without looking away from the target. The spin is
  a keyframe animation, so it runs on the compositor and the frame loop writes nothing per frame
  but a position and two custom properties.
  **`transform-box: view-box` is load-bearing** — without it each group spins about its own
  tight bounding box rather than the shared middle, and the layers wobble apart instead of
  turning together. The spin and the convergence are on NESTED elements, or the two transforms
  fight over one property.
  **Locked is a different MARK, not a brighter one**: it goes warm and the brackets stop
  breathing and snap in, so "the gun has something" is a glance rather than a comparison against
  a memory of what it looked like a second ago.
- **THE MARK AND THE SHOT HAVE TO BE ONE ANSWER, AND "BY CONSTRUCTION" IS A CLAIM THAT HAS TO
  BE TRUE (m20).** *"Even though it was locked on and the reticle was locked on, as soon as you
  release it shoots where the camera is pointing and not where the reticle is. I've had this
  exact same problem in other games."* The note that used to sit here said this was impossible:
  `aimPoint` walks from the muzzle along `cam.az`, the reticle is drawn at what it finds and
  `fireBolt` aims at the same point. All true -- **and `paintRetic` drew the mark on the LOCKED
  MAN instead, while `fireBolt` went on calling `aimPoint`, which has never heard of the lock.**
  Two places agreeing about the unlocked case and disagreeing about the locked one is exactly
  what "by construction" is supposed to rule out, so the claim was the bug hiding the bug.
  `aimTarget()` is the one answer now and both call it. **A mark the gun does not keep is worse
  than no assist at all** -- and worse than it sounds, because the lock is what makes you stop
  aiming.
- **A JUMP IN THE WORLD CAN ONLY BE ANSWERED BY A FILTER (m23).** *"I'm charging the shot, I'm
  scanning left to right, and then it clocks a cube that's closer and it jumps to lower down the
  screen. I don't like the jumpy behaviour -- it needs to ease that transition, and the aim
  assist needs to ease to its assisted position too."* Both halves are the same thing and
  neither is a bug in the probe: one frame the walk runs sixty metres to open ground and the
  next it stops at a box eight metres away, and those genuinely ARE two different places. No
  finer bisection removes a discontinuity that is real. Acquiring a lock is the same step, from
  wherever the walk landed onto a man's chest, and it is metres wide however narrow the cone is.
  **THE HEIGHT GETS ITS OWN, SLOWER HALF-LIFE** (`AIM.halfY` .16 against `.075`). The mark's job
  is to say where the shot lands in PLAN; its height is a detail, and it is the only axis a
  camera pitched down turns into visible bobbing -- which is the word he used.
  **SEEDED, NOT EASED, ON THE FIRST FRAME**, or it slides in from wherever the gun was last
  pointed, which reads as the reticle chasing rather than appearing.
  **And it is still ONE answer** -- `aimTarget` eases and both the mark and the bolt read it, so
  m20's invariant survives rather than being re-broken by the fix for the jitter.
- **AN ASSIST'S CONE IS SIZED FOR WHAT IT DELIVERS, NOT FOR WHAT IT DRAWS (m20).** `LOCK.cone`
  was 1.05 rad -- **sixty degrees either side** to acquire, and with `LOCK.keep` **eighty-seven**
  to hold. That is survivable for a mark that only draws and absurd for one the round follows:
  *"I was aiming almost ninety degrees away from one cop and it kept locking onto one further to
  the left."* The subtlety is the cone; the DELIVERY still has to be total, or it is the bullet
  above again.
  **AND `keep` WAS THE STICKY HALF (m27).** *"Two cops a similar distance apart, I was trying to
  aim at one and it kept locking the other, and moving it over still wouldn't get off him."* At
  1.25 the man already locked was judged against a cone **25% wider** than the one he was being
  compared to, so a target the thumb was plainly ON could not win. .19 / .06 / **1.06** -- about
  11 deg to acquire, 3.5 once loaded, and just enough hysteresis to stop a flicker between two
  men shoulder to shoulder. `MELEE.aimCone` went .95 -> .42 with it (54 deg was most of the
  screen) and `aimNear` .35 -> .55, because swinging at two men the NEAR one is what you meant.
- **A RETICLE IS A POINTER, AND AT 146 px IT COVERED A MAN AT TWENTY METRES.** 74. The one thing
  a mark must not do is hide the thing it is marking.
- **A BLOW IS THE LIMB ARRIVING, NOT A RANGE CHECK (m20).** *"The cops are getting hit before the
  swing even happens. It's just sort of: are you within range? did you melee? yes, OK, cop has
  been hit. It's not really actually having a velocity collider effect."* Precisely what it was,
  in two places at once:
    1. `dummyHit` tested a CIRCLE about the player's centre and used `dirH` only to decide which
       way to throw him -- **so there was no direction test at all** and a man standing BEHIND
       him was hit by a punch thrown forwards.
    2. and with a melee lock, the contact fired the moment he was inside `MELEE.reach`, which on
       a nine-metre lunge is well before the arm has begun to move. `MELEE.lockAt` then fired it
       on a timer if he never arrived.
  **So the fist, the boot and the weapon's far end are SWEPT.** Each frame of a strike their
  world positions come off the rig and the segment from last frame to this one is tested against
  the body as a vertical cylinder. Nothing is typed per clip and nothing has to say which strike
  is a punch and which is a kick: whichever limb reaches him is the one that lands.
  **AND THE SPEED IS MEASURED IN HIS OWN FRAME.** A fist carried along by a nine-metre lunge is
  not a punch -- without subtracting the root's own travel every strike connects with everything
  it runs past, which is a range check wearing a sweep's clothes.
  **The sweep runs every frame of the strike even while the window is shut**, because the
  positions it measures against have to stay exactly one frame old; a sweep seeded three frames
  back is a segment across half the room. It is re-seeded at the start of each strike for the
  same reason.
  **`MELEE.at` stops FIRING the blow and only opens the window**, and `MELEE.arrive` came down
  to 1.05 m so the solved lunge lands inside what a swept fist can actually reach. A swing that
  does not reach him now misses, which is the point.
  **The chip marks a connected swing with `!`** (`melee2!`, `swing!`) -- "it hit him before the
  swing" and "it never reached him at all" are opposite bugs and one picture from a phone.
- **THE MUZZLE IS MEASURED; `weapon_tip` IS NOT IT.** On the blaster the mesh runs from +11.7 to
  −38.2 along the mount's X while the tip marker sits at −14.3, about 28% along. The marker pair
  defines the mount's POSITION and AXIS, which is all it is for. The muzzle is the far end of
  the geometry along that axis, which needs no marker and survives a re-model.
- **THE GUN'S BLUE PARTS ARE IN THE TEXTURE, NOT IN A MATERIAL.** The blaster is one mesh on one
  material, so there is no "blue part" to pick out by name — but the map knows which texels are
  blue, so the shader can. Blueness is **blue minus red**, not blue minus the brighter of the
  other two: the accents are CYAN, so green is high there as well and a `max()` test scores them
  near zero and lights up nothing. `b - r` is zero on every grey, white and warm texel and high
  on anything blue or cyan. One uniform, driven by the charge.
  **A material carrying a custom hook needs its own `customProgramCacheKey`** or three can hand
  it a program compiled for something else.
- **A STRIKE TAKES A FIXED BEAT AND THE CLIP IS COMPRESSED TO IT.** The authored melee clips run
  1.0 to 1.75 s, so a three-hit chain at 1× is over four seconds of watching, which reads as lag
  rather than as a combo. `MELEE.beat` is the beat and `playOnce` scales the clip to fit.
  **And he holds his speed before he scrubs it** (`MELEE.carry`): a flat linear bleed averages
  half the launch speed, so every metre of travel has to be bought with a speed spike at the
  front — which reads as a rocket rather than a lunge.
- **THE HOLD HAS TO BUY SOMETHING, AND THE KNOCK-DOWN THRESHOLD SAT AT 23% (m22).** *"Little
  shots just hit them and the cop does the little animation where he takes a punch, but past
  about a half charge he gets launched a little, three-quarter a little further, a full charge
  sends him flying."* A bolt's power was `.45 + chg * .75`, which crosses `DUMMY.hard` (.62) at
  **chg 0.23** -- so the lightest real shot already put a man on his back and everything above
  it was the same event slightly harder. A charge shot whose whole range is above the threshold
  is not a charge shot.
  **`pow0` IS SOLVED, NOT PICKED**: the crossing has to land at half, so
  `pow0 + .5(1 - pow0) = hard` gives .24, and `pow1` is the melee finisher's own 1.0.
  **AND HOW FAR HE FLIES IS GRADED ABOVE THE THRESHOLD, SQUARED.** One `power` deciding both
  whether he goes down and how hard can only ever give one launch, so `DUMMY.fly0` scales the
  EXCESS -- .30 at the threshold itself, full at full power, squared between because a linear
  ramp spends most of its range looking the same and the top is the part worth having:
      chg .25  power .43  stagger        chg .75  power .81  4.0 m/s
      chg .50  power .62  2.6 m/s        chg 1.0  power 1.00 8.5 m/s + 5.4 up
  Melee is untouched: .45 / .52 still stagger and the finisher's 1.0 still gets the full launch.
- **THE CHARGED SWING IS A SOLVED ARC, NOT A FIXED LEAP (m21).** *"If he's much closer he'll
  jump way higher, and if he's farther away he'll jump way farther. Right now it's always the
  same distance, so if he's really close and you try the charge attack he just jumps through
  them."* A constant launch can only do one distance, and every other distance is either short
  or through him. The gap decides the SHAPE:
      apex   lerp(finishHiNear 2.4, finishHiFar 1.1) by how far away he is
      vy     sqrt(2 g h) -- so the apex IS the number being set, not a velocity guessed at
      T      2 vy / g -- the flight time falls out of the arc rather than being typed
      vx     gap / T, which lands him ON the man by construction at any distance
  Full charge, g = 20: gap 0 -> 2.4 m up, 0.98 s, no travel; gap 8 -> 1.45 m, 0.76 s, 10.5 m/s;
  gap 11 (the reach) -> 1.1 m, 0.66 s, 16.6 m/s.
  **AND THE CLIP IS COMPRESSED TO T**, because a state whose length disagrees with the clip it
  plays can only ever cut that clip off -- paid for once already at m8.
  **A LEAP IN THE AIR KEEPS ITS SPEED.** `MELEE.carry`'s bleed is for a grounded lunge; applied
  to a ballistic arc it lands him short of everything it was solved for. The charged swing only
  takes the bleed once his feet are back down, where it is a skid.
  **The chip reads `swing<gap>/<apex>`** and gains `!` when the sweep connects.
- **THE TAIL OF A STRIKE IS CANCELLABLE.** Holding the whole clip makes a chain feel like
  watching rather than playing; past `MELEE.hold` the stick takes him out of the recovery, which
  is what makes each link a decision.

- **A BOX TOP WITHIN `step` OF HIS FEET IS A FLOOR, NOT A WALL** — and the two halves of the
  collider disagreed about that for the first draft. `groundAt` was perfectly happy to put him
  on top of a 40 cm kerb while `resolveBoxes` pushed him off the side of it, because the only
  exemption there was "already above it". The result: he ground to a halt against every low box
  in the world and the step-up was unreachable. **`npm run check:sim` found it on its first
  run**, in two cases at once — "reaches MOVE.max" read 0.00 m/s because he was pressed against
  a kerb for the whole test. Neither the syntax gate nor the boot gate can see this: one parses
  and the other never steps a player.
- **A HARNESS THAT KEEPS DRIVING AFTER THE THING UNDER TEST HAS FINISHED IS MEASURING ITS OWN
  INPUT.** The step-up case held the stick for 2.5 s and read the END state — by which point he
  had walked onto the box, across it and off the far side — so it reported y 0.00 and called a
  working step-up a failure. It records the highest ground he ever stood on instead.
- **AND A CHECK WHOSE PASS MARK IS INVENTED MEASURES THE INVENTION.** The "boxes are solid" case
  asserted he stop past −4.4 when the face is at −4.90 and he is a cylinder of radius 0.34, so
  the correct stop is −4.56 — a clean stop failed a made-up threshold. Derive the pass mark from
  the geometry, never from what looks about right.

- **THE COLUMNS WERE ALL FLOATING, AND "IT PRODUCED BOXES" IS NOT "IT PRODUCED A COLLIDER"
  (m34, `npm run bld`).** *"No. There is no collider on the building whatsoever."* m32 fixed the
  TDZ and the boxes really were reaching `BOXES` after it -- **and every one of them was
  hanging in the air at roof height**, so `resolveBoxes` skipped the lot on
  `p.y + hh < b.miny` and nothing changed on the phone.
  **A GENERATED BUILDING HAS NO VERTICAL FACES.** m26's reading took a triangle's PLANE height
  at the cell centre as both the low and the high mark whenever the face was not exactly
  vertical, and kept the full y span only when it was. That is right for an architectural box
  and meaningless for a Tripo shell, where every triangle is slanted: each cell got ONE number,
  lo == hi, and the whole collider came out as zero-height plates lying on the surface. The
  `flat` branch was the bug and it looked like the careful half of the function.
  **SO IT IS A PARITY VOXELISER NOW, WHICH IS WHAT "INSIDE THE SOLID" MEANS.** Every height at
  which a vertical ray through the cell centre crosses the surface, sorted, paired in-out-in-out.
  A vertical face has no XZ area and a vertical ray cannot cross one, which is correct: the
  crossings come from floors, roofs and slopes, and a canopy is simply a second pair.
  **AND AN ODD COUNT MEANS THE SHELL IS OPEN UNDERNEATH**, which a generated building usually
  is -- a skin with no floor. One crossing on the way up is a roof with nothing below it.
  Closing it at the model's own floor is the honest repair: the solid runs from the ground to
  the surface, which is what a building standing on the ground IS.
  **THE BOUNDING BOX PICKS THE CELLS AND THE TRIANGLE DECIDES**, in XZ now as well -- marking
  every cell in the bbox is the same "a triangle's bounding box is not its shape" error this
  file already had a note about, one axis pair over.
  **AND THERE IS A NET UNDER IT (`bldCols`, `BLD FLAT`).** Walking through a building is
  strictly worse than a boxy collider, so if no column comes within `MOVE.step` of the ground
  the columns are thrown away, the bounding box goes in instead and the chip says so. One
  function does that at build time AND after `mel.bld()` re-sizes, because two copies of the
  decision is two places for the fallback to be missing from.
  **THE CHIP CARRIES `BX<n>`.** Three builds went on this with nothing on screen able to tell a
  builder that threw from a rasteriser that produced boxes nobody can reach, and there is no
  console on a phone. `BX0` is the fault; any number at all is not.
  **A VERTICAL COLUMN CANNOT EXPRESS A DOORWAY THROUGH A ROOFED SHELL**, and that is a stated
  limit rather than an oversight: a ray down through the doorway still hits the roof and the
  floor, so it reads as inside. Overhangs, canopies and setbacks it does express. m26's note
  listed a doorway among the things columns fix; that was never true.
  **`npm run bld` LIFTS THE SHIPPED `solidColumns`** between the `COLS:` markers and runs it
  over shells built in the harness -- no GLB, because the building is draco and nothing here can
  decode it. **Verified by running it against the m33 file**: the slanted no-floor shell comes
  back **8 of 335 boxes touching the ground** against 222 of 236 after.
  **AND ITS FIRST TWO VERSIONS BOTH MEASURED NOTHING.** The shells all had VERTICAL walls, which
  is the one case m33 got right, so it passed the broken code -- a harness whose fixtures avoid
  the failing shape is a harness that measures a different asset. And the canopy assertion asked
  for a box at `minx > 10.5` when a merged run starts on a cell edge at exactly 10, failing a
  correct answer: **derive the pass mark from the geometry, never from what looks about right.**
- **A TOWER IS A TALLER BUILDING, SO IT IS A TABLE AND NOT A SECOND BUILDER (m60, `TOWER`,
  `buildBuildings(g, K)`, `bldSize`).** *"I added a towers folder. Towers are just like much way
  taller buildings, so probably double if not triple the size of the building -- maybe just
  double for now."* Which is `d.K`'s own shape one asset over: the bolt, `resolveBoxes`,
  `groundAt`, the camera boom and the chip's `BX<n>` already reach anything in `BOXES`, so a
  tower needs **no second builder, no second collider path and no second thing to keep in step**
  -- it is a second table handed to the same function.
  **THE BUILDER READ `BLD` IN EIGHT PLACES AND `bldCols` IN TWO.** Every one takes `K` now, and
  `b.K` rides on each placed object so the re-size and the rasteriser read the table their own
  building was built from. **That last part is not cosmetic**: a tower is twice as tall on the
  same `cell`, so it rasterises to roughly twice the columns, and reading the global would have
  handed it the building's `maxCells` -- where the cell silently GROWS to fit rather than the
  mesh being skipped, so the collider would have come out coarser exactly where the building is
  biggest, with nothing on screen to say so. `TOWER.maxCells` is 8192.
  **AND `mel.bld` / `mel.tower` ARE ONE FUNCTION WITH TWO HANDLES.** `bldSize(K, h)` filters
  `BUILDINGS` by table, because `mel.tower(48)` must not re-scale the building and `mel.bld()`
  must not squash the tower -- which is what the old global-reading version would have done to
  both. `mel.tower(48)` is the triple he floated.
  **THE PLACEMENT IS CHECKED AS RECTANGLES, NOT PICKED BY EYE.** A 19.5 m footprint at
  (-28, 30) clears all ten boxes, the building's own plan and every one of the thirteen bodies,
  with its nearest corner 27 m from the spawn. Two of the six candidates I tried did NOT --
  (-28, 18) sits on the box at (-16, 12) -- and a building overlapping a box is the m24 lesson
  exactly: nothing on screen disagrees with anything and the player simply cannot walk there.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY.** The tower is draco, so `check:boot` never enters the builder
  (headless every `loadGLB` rejects) and `npm run bld` cannot decode it -- it runs `solidColumns`
  over shells it builds itself. So **whether it stands upright and what its collider comes out
  as are device questions**, and the chip is what answers the second one: `BX<n>` is the total,
  and `TOWER FLAT` is the bounding-box fallback firing. The arithmetic that CAN be checked here
  -- the world span, the scale, the footprint and the clearance -- is above and was.

- **PUNCH IS ENERGY IN THE FIRST FEW MILLISECONDS, AND IT IS THE FRONT OF THE FILE THAT IS IN
  THE WAY (m59, `SFX.punch`, `snd`'s `cut`/`att`/`dec`, `PUNCH`).** *"The explosion noise we were
  using was way too punchy and these ones are way too soft, so I don't really know how we could
  maybe change the waveform somehow to make it punchier."* **The waveform is fine.** Every
  recording in the bank climbs for 34 to 111 ms before it reaches its own peak, and `SFX.edge`
  opens at a QUARTER of that peak with 30 ms of run-up kept -- which is exactly right for a
  swoosh and is the wrong end of the file for an impact. **A sound that takes a tenth of a second
  to arrive is a swell, not a hit.** Measured over the first 25 ms of what is actually played:
      played from the ONSET        rms .0006 to .034     <- "way too soft", and that IS nothing
      played from the 90% POINT    rms .148 to .282      <- x5 to x259, per file
      explosion_small, for scale   rms .527              <- "way too punchy"
  So the target sits squarely BETWEEN the two he named, it is reached rather than guessed, and
  **no sample is touched**: `cut` is a different start offset and nothing else. `e.p` is stored
  on every edge record at load, so the scan is paid once per file per session.
  **AND `dec` IS THE OTHER HALF.** An impact is a transient and a short tail; held flat, a file
  with a long loud body reads as a TONE however hard it starts -- which is what `explosion_small`
  got wrong from the far side (it hits at .527 and then keeps going for 1.2 s). `att` is
  milliseconds up and **never zero, because a gain that steps is a click**, then
  `setTargetAtTime` down with a time constant of `dec/3`, so it is ~95% gone by `dec` and ~99%
  by the stop at `dec * 1.6`. `dur`'s linear tail stands down when `dec` is set: two envelopes
  on one gain is two writers on one number.
  **AND `npm run sfx` MEASURES THE RATIO NOW**, per file, as `skip / raw25 / cut25 / punch` --
  so "how punchy is this recording" has an answer before it is ever heard on a phone, and the
  next bank he cuts can be judged the same way. It reads `SFX.punch` out of `index.html` with
  the other two constants and exits 1 rather than guessing.
  **WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE NEXT RECORDING** is the part worth keeping: a punchy impact starts
  AT its peak. If the export has a fade-in on it, the game can throw that away for free -- but
  nothing can add an attack that was never recorded, and `cut` is the whole of what is available
  from this side.
- **THE SHOT WENT BACK AND THE BANK MOVED TO THE IMPACT (m59).** *"I actually liked the noise we
  were using for the plasma shot before, it was punchier -- I kind of wanna revert it to that.
  Maybe we use those plasma noises for the hit sounds, and they're random or something."*
  Both halves in one build, and m58's line is restored byte for byte: `blaster_sound_01/02` on
  an ordinary release and rapid-fire round, `plasma_canon` past a .82 charge.
  **THE SOFTNESS THAT MADE THEM WRONG FOR A SHOT IS ANSWERABLE AT AN IMPACT**, which is the
  whole reason this is not simply a revert: a shot LEAVES and an impact ARRIVES, and `cut`/`dec`
  only mean anything for the second. The same files he rejected in one slot are the right files
  in the other once the run-up comes off the front.
  **`plasma_hit` IS IN THE BANK RATHER THAN BESIDE IT.** It is one more impact recording; a
  second key for one file is a second thing to keep in step, and `splat` is gone. Ranked by the
  same measurement it lands sixth of seven (score .0801), and **`npm run sfx`'s own ranking was
  widened to include it** -- it keyed on `plasma_\d`, so the tool would have gone on printing a
  six-file order that disagreed with the shipped seven-file list, which is precisely the drift
  this repo keeps paying for.
  **THE CHARGE STILL PICKS THE WINDOW**, so a full charge lands with a heavier recording and it
  is still random inside it -- which is what *"random or something"* asks for and keeps m58's
  measurement doing work. At `PLASMA.span` 3 of 7:
      chg 0.00   06:33% 04:34% 03:33%                         chg 0.50   03:33% 05:33% 02:34%
      chg 1.00                            02:33% hit:34% 01:33%
  `mel.PLASMA.span = 7` makes it flat; `mel.PUNCH.dec = 0` plays a file whole, which is the A/B
  back to what he heard.

- **HIS PLASMA BANK, AND THE FILES WERE ASKED RATHER THAN RANKED BY EAR (m58, `npm run sfx`,
  `plasmaPick`).** *"There's five or six plasma shot sounds and then one plasma hit... maybe run
  a little test and gauge the intensity of each of the waveforms, and then you could map that for
  the charge so that when it charges more it plays a more intense one -- or you could just
  randomly select one and make whatever one you select stronger for that specific charge."*
  **BOTH, AND THEY ARE NOT ALTERNATIVES: the FILE gives the character and the GAIN gives the
  charge.** Each alone has a failure the other does not:
      ranked only   a full charge is the SAME recording every time, which is exactly the "it
                    always does the same thing" this file has already paid for twice
      random only   a fumble can draw the heaviest file and the charge stops reading in the
                    sound at all -- the one thing he asked the ranking for
  So the charge picks a WINDOW in the ranked bank and rolls inside it (`PLASMA.span` 3 of 6),
  and the gain and rate ride on top. Measured over the shipped arithmetic:
      chg 0.00   06:33%  04:33%  03:33%   --   --   --
      chg 0.50    --     04:17%  03:34%  05:33%  02:17%   --
      chg 1.00    --      --      --     05:33%  02:34%  01:33%
      auto       every file 17%, flat
  **RAPID FIRE IS A FLAT ROLL, which is his instruction and is also right.** `autoChg` is .16, so
  a windowed pick would pin every round to the light end for ever; eight shots a second need
  variety rather than weight. And `SFX.gap` .045 is under `autoRate` .11, so every round is heard
  rather than every other one being refused.
  **`npm run sfx` MEASURES THE WINDOW THE GAME WILL ACTUALLY PLAY**, by lifting the shipped
  `sfxEdge` between the new `EDGE:` markers -- a tool with its own copy of the rule is this
  repo's oldest mistake. Its own constants (`SFX.hit`, `SFX.pre`) are parsed out of `index.html`
  too, and it exits 1 rather than guessing if it cannot find them.
      plasma_06  0.47s  rms .099  body .30  score .0494   <- lightest, and the shortest
      plasma_04  0.65   rms .121  body .09        .0562
      plasma_03  0.89   rms .113  body .08        .0597
      plasma_05  0.60   rms .138  body .12        .0636
      plasma_02  0.86   rms .117  body .21        .0729   (a 100 ms lead-in and a slow swell)
      plasma_01  0.84   rms .188  body .30        .1363   <- heaviest, x2.76 over the lightest
  **PEAK IS NOT INTENSITY AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THE TOOL EXISTS.** Every one of these is
  at or near normalised (0.46 to 0.91), so ranking on peak puts the entire bank in a dead heat.
  What separates them is ENERGY in the played window, how long it runs, and how much of it is
  loud. Peak is still printed, because a file that is NOT normalised would otherwise hide.
  **RE-RUN IT AFTER ANY RE-EXPORT AND RE-ORDER `SFX.files.plasma`** -- `plasmaPick` depends on
  that list being lightest-first and has no way to know if it is not.
  **AN ID3v2 TAG IS NOT AUDIO, AND IT COST THE FIRST TWO RUNS.** Every file here carries one and
  his plasma exports carry **10 KB of it on a 30 KB file** -- a third of the bytes. Fed from byte
  zero, mpg123's streaming decode returns `MPG123_ERR` on every frame and allocates until node
  dies of an OOM, which reads exactly like a corrupt recording and is nothing of the sort. **The
  browser's `decodeAudioData` handles the tag perfectly well**, so this is a harness concern and
  there is nothing to fix in the asset. The syncsafe length is at bytes 6-9. And a FRESH decoder
  per file: `reset()` is async and leaves `ready` already settled, so reusing one across a bank
  is the other half of that OOM.
  **`audio/plasma_sounds` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`.** `readdirSync` is not recursive,
  so a new asset folder is a new entry there or every file in it goes stale silently -- the
  standing tax, and the third time it has been paid across these repos.
- **THE BOLT'S IMPACT IS HIS FILE NOW, AND THE `dur` CAP WENT WITH THE STAND-IN (m58).** *"The
  plasma hit, I think, is the sound that'll play when it actually hits a character."*
  **THE CAP EXISTED FOR THE STAND-IN AND WOULD HAVE CHOPPED THE RECORDING.** m55 pointed `splat`
  at `electricity_beam_01.mp3` -- a SEVEN-SECOND beam -- and `dur: .12 + chg * .10` is what made
  that an instant. `plasma_hit` is 0.89 s with a 92 ms attack and IS an impact, so the same cap
  would now be cutting his own file off a tenth of a second in. `SFX.edge` still trims the
  silence, which is all the trimming a real recording wants. **A number that exists to rescue a
  stand-in has to go when the stand-in does**, or the fix for one file becomes a bug in the next.
  **AND A MAN IS NOT TARMAC.** The blast lands wherever the bolt dies and a near miss into the
  wall behind him must not be silent -- that is what an area weapon IS (m56) -- but landing ON
  somebody is a different event, so it comes in fuller and lower. **`b.onMan` is set where the
  flight test actually caught a body**, not inferred afterwards from the blast.
  **AND THE FIRST VERSION READ `hitBodies` IN ITS TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE.** The sound went above the
  blast call it reads from -- a `ReferenceError` on **every bolt death**, and invisible to both
  gates: `check:syntax` parses, and `check:boot` never fires a bolt. Ninth time across these
  repos, caught by reading rather than by running, which is not a method to rely on.

- **TWO WOMEN, A FIREFIGHTER, AND EVERYBODY IS PLAYABLE NOW (m144, `GIRL`, `hCrown`, `ownRef`,
  `SHE.r`).** *"I added three more characters. None of them have animations -- actually one of
  them has a female walk in it and we can use that walk for the pretty girls... but they're gonna
  need to borrow all the animations from the other mixamo skeletons for any detailed behavior.
  Also one of my characters from earlier I can't shoot and turn into with the DNA gun -- it's the
  female alien that's not the rollerblader, and that's one of my favourite characters. Everybody
  should be playable."*
  **ALL THREE MEASURE CLEAN, THE SAME WAY m143's SIX DID**: 66 joints, every one of `MORPH.needs`
  present, one skinned mesh, toes at **+Z (0.00 deg)**, and a bind pose **0.00 deg** off the donor
  on every shared bone with the Hips delta exactly **90.00** (they carry a `root` null, so they
  are in zap's family and the biker is in the other one -- which is the whole of the difference
  and is one constant rotation).
  **AND `bodyBorrow`'s GATE WAS ALL-OR-NOTHING, WHICH THIS REQUEST IS EXACTLY THE CASE FOR.**
  `if (!K.borrow || clips.length) return 0` -- so **the one character who brought an animation
  would have been the one character who ended up with ONLY that animation**, walking everywhere
  and doing nothing else. It fills per CLIP NAME now, from an ORDERED LIST of donors, first one
  wins. Shredworld's `ownClips` rule arriving here: *name the clips you have redone and the rest
  keep coming from the donor.*
  **THE BLONDE'S DONOR IS THE ASIAN AND THE BIKER IS BEHIND HER.** `female_walk` is in the
  asian's file, so she is loaded first and lends it on. **The second hop is exact rather than
  close**: every rig in this repo reads 0.00 deg off every other on every shared bone, so the two
  deltas are pure family rotations and they compose; `k` composes with them.
  **AND A REFERENCE SPEED RIDES WITH ITS CLIP.** `walkRef` is read off whichever donor actually
  supplied the clip named by `K.clips.walk`, or off `ownRef` when the body brought its own -- so
  the blonde's walk is measured off `female_walk` and not off a clip she never plays.
  **MEASURED: `female_walk` is 1.417 s and its planted foot slides 0.6345 authored units/s**,
  `npm run gait`'s own method (the slower foot each frame, at its plateau) run offline against the
  raw samplers. **Cross-checked on the one clip whose answer is already in this file**:
  `alien_female_purple`'s walk reads 0.5282 against the 0.529 her shipped `walkRef` implies --
  **0.2% apart**, which is what says the 0.6345 can be trusted rather than merely computed.
- **AND `K.h / D.h` WAS THE WRONG GAIT FACTOR, WHICH IS AN m143 BUG THIS BUILD FIXES (m144).**
  A reference speed is authored travel TIMES the scale the model is drawn at, so the factor
  between two bodies is `scale_T / scale_S` -- and `K.h / D.h` is a BBOX ratio standing in for a
  SCALE ratio. Under `hRel` every borrower is drawn at the donor's own scale exactly, so the
  honest factor is **1.000** and the shipped one ran from **0.906 (trump) to 1.017 (activist)**:
  up to **9.4% of foot slide** on a body whose clips were right all along. Same class as reading
  a height off a bounding box, one quantity over.
- **A BOUNDING BOX IS THE WRONG RULER ACROSS TWO NORMALISATION FAMILIES, AND THE HEAD IS WHAT
  PROVES IT (m144, `K.hCrown`).** m143 stated this confound and could not quantify it; it is
  quantified now. Every export here is normalised so its LONGEST axis is exactly 1.000 -- and
  which axis that is depends on the ARM POSE:
      the fat roster   X 1.000, Y .78 to .88   -> normalised on the ARM SPAN
      the two girls    Y 1.000, X .698 / .753  -> normalised on the HEIGHT, arms at their sides
  So `hRel` would compare height-over-armspan against height, and on `beautiful_asian` it
  overstates her by **9%** -- a 2.05 m woman.
  **`Head -> HeadTop_End` MEASURES 0.2328 ON ELEVEN OF THE FOURTEEN CHARACTER FILES**, to four
  decimal places, which is the untouched Mixamo default: the armatures really are in one shared
  unit and a SKELETAL landmark is comparable across them where a mesh bbox is not. The three
  exceptions are the two girls (0.1462 and 0.1979) and they are the tell rather than a problem --
  those rigs are drawn **6.5 and 5.0 heads tall** against everybody else's 3.3 to 4.0, and their
  legs are **x1.92** the biker's. That is a deliberate proportion, not a scale.
  **SO `hCrown` IS A CROWN HEIGHT IN METRES AND THE SCALE IS SOLVED FOR IT**, typed once for a
  FAMILY rather than per body -- and the one number is not taste either: **1.725 m is where
  `alien_female_purple`'s crown already lands** (1.0148 x her 1.70), so the three women in this
  game are the same height as each other by construction and the one he already likes sets it.
      asian    crown 0.9483 -> x1.8191, drawn 1.84 m to the top of her hair
      blonde   crown 0.9945 -> x1.7346, drawn 1.73
  **AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT USED ON THE FAT SIX**, because their crown BONE sits ABOVE their
  own mesh -- the biker's is 0.8805 against a 0.8638 bbox, a default head-top bone on a squashed
  head -- so for them the bbox is the honest measure and `hRel` compares like with like. Two
  rulers, two questions, and each one stated where it is valid.
  **THE FIREFIGHTER NEEDED NEITHER.** His export is in the fat family and his authored Y span is
  **0.8638, the biker's to four decimals**, so `hRel` lands him at exactly 1.75 m and his refs at
  exactly the biker's.
- **SHE WAS NEVER REFUSED BY THE DNA GUN; SHE WAS NEVER LOOKED AT (m144).** `dnaCatch` loops
  `DUMMIES` and `alien_female_purple` is not in it -- she is `buildShe`, her own path, with no
  collider, no brain, no health bar and no spawn. `dnaOK` would have passed her on every count
  (idle, walk, run) except the one thing she had no way to have: a **proto**.
  **SO THE SAMPLER GAINS A SECOND SOURCE RATHER THAN HER GAINING A BODY.** Moving her into
  `DUMMIES` would give her all four of those things and change what she IS; she is one more
  candidate scored by the same distance, so the nearest still wins and there is no second rule
  about who beats whom.
  **AND THE PROTO IS A CLONE NOTHING HAS EVER ANIMATED**, which is the load-bearing half:
  `mphSkin` takes its bind pose from `skeletonClone(P.proto)` and that is only a bind pose while
  the proto has never been touched by a mixer -- so it cannot be the instance walking the
  circuit. A clone shares the geometry and the materials, so the second copy is a skeleton and
  nothing else. `normaliseClips` runs on both paths and **is idempotent** (the second pass finds
  `t0` already 0 and filters a list already filtered), and `bodyProto`'s de-drift is a free fix
  for her: her walk banks **2.20 units** of hips drift over its 7.5 s loop and her run **2.61**,
  which is a 4 cm snap back every time round.
  **`r: .38` IS THE ONLY NEW FIELD** -- what the catch is sized against and what `spkCling`
  throws its swarm round.
- **AND THE OFFICER IS WEARABLE, WHICH IS THE LAST "EVERYBODY" (m144).** He was the one body in
  the game `dnaOK` refused, correctly: an idle and fifteen reactions and **no gait at all**. He
  measures 0.00 deg off the biker's bind on all 56 shared bones and carries every joint the
  retarget needs, so a gait is one donor line.
  **HE STILL NEVER MOVES** -- `foeAI` is gated on `K.ai` and he has none -- so what this buys is
  a disguise rather than a fourth pedestrian.
  **AND HE IS DELIBERATELY GIVEN NO `air` CLIP.** m90's finding is that a body which plays its
  FALL clip for the whole flight AND the landing reads right; he already has that BECAUSE the
  field is absent, and naming `in_air` here would hand him a float LOOP and put the fall back to
  starting after he has already landed. **A field left empty is a behaviour, not an omission.**
  **AND `DUMMY.borrow` IS ASSIGNED AFTER THE `BIKER` TABLE, NOT WRITTEN IN HIS OWN.** `DUMMY` is
  declared eight hundred lines above `BIKER`, and a `const` read above its own declaration is a
  blank page -- this file's oldest landmine, ninth time, and the one thing `npm run check:boot`
  exists to catch.
- **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY (m144):** there is no GPU here and no harness in this repo can
  build a skin (draco wants a Worker), so **whether the three stand up in the borrowed clips, and
  whether 1.73 m reads as a pretty girl rather than a tall one, are device questions.** The
  arithmetic that CAN be checked is above and was: the bind deltas, the crown ruler, the head
  control, the measured walk and its cross-check, and the three spawn clearances. Both gates
  pass. `mel.dna('female')` wears the alien girl from a console and `mel.dna('officer')` the
  officer; `mel.CIVILS` is live and `hCrown` wants a reload.
- **A DISGUISE IS THE SAME SCALE AS THE MAN IT IS A DISGUISE FOR, AND I COULD NOT FIND A CODE
  PATH THAT MAKES IT BIGGER (m132, `drawnH`).** *"When I transform into the characters I'm
  actually a bigger version of themselves -- I should match them. I don't wanna be bigger than
  anything smaller but same size is probably good."*
  **THE TWO SCALES ARE PROVABLY ONE LINE, WHICH IS WHY THIS BUILD IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A
  FIX.** Read straight off both paths:
      bodySpawn   model.scale.setScalar(P.scale)              P.scale = K.h / authored
      mphSkin     model.scale.setScalar(P.scale * h / K.h)    h = MORPH.tall ? K.h : RIG.height
      MORPH.tall is 1, so `h` IS `K.h`, so the second reduces to the first EXACTLY
  Both clone the same `K.P.proto`, so `authored` is the same bounding box; `mphWear` only swaps
  which model hangs off `rig.root`; and **nothing anywhere in the file writes `rig.root.scale` or
  `rig.model.scale`** -- grepped, not assumed. So there is no scale to be wrong.
  **SAYING THAT WITHOUT A NUMBER ON SCREEN IS AN ARGUMENT, NOT AN ANSWER**, and he is the one
  watching it move. The chip carries his DRAWN height and the nearest NPC of that kind's, in
  centimetres: `DNA WARRIOR 185/185`. Equal means the size is right and what is left is the SHOT;
  unequal names its own fault and I was wrong. `--` means no body of that kind is near enough.
  **AND THE HONEST CANDIDATE, STATED AS ONE: `CAM.dist` IS 5.0 AND DOES NOT SCALE WITH THE BODY.**
  At a five-metre boom an NPC standing two metres further back reads **5/7 = 0.71** -- the near
  body is 40% bigger for no other reason than depth -- and in both screenshots the NPC is behind
  and to one side, feet higher on screen. m122 already scales `CAM.look` by `bodyK()` and
  deliberately leaves `dist` alone, so a 1.85 m disguise also fills 48% more of the frame than
  zap's 1.25 m body does. Scaling the boom by `bodyK()` would flatten both (7.4 m puts that ratio
  at 0.79) and is the change to reach for IF the chip reads equal. **It is NOT shipped here**,
  because a build that changes the lens and the diagnostic at once is a build neither of which
  can be judged.
  **`setFromObject` IS THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THIS ONE QUESTION AND THE STANDING RULE SAYS IT IS
  NOT.** That rule is about AUTHORED height -- a skinned mesh ignores its node transform at bind,
  so applying it there gives a hundredth of his size. Drawn height is the opposite question:
  geometry bounds WITH the chain applied, which is exactly what that function computes. And
  measuring off the PROTO instead would be a tautology -- both paths share one proto, so it would
  report agreement by construction and could never catch a disagreement, which is `normGeo`'s own
  mistake wearing a tape measure.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** `p.mphK` is never set headless, so neither gate executes the
  new branch -- what they cover is that the module still evaluates and the line parses. Both pass.

- **HIS OWN FOOTSTEPS, AND THE FILENAMES CARRY THE FOOT (m136, `SFX.files.foot`, `footSnd`).**
  *"I added two new footsteps, one for left foot one for right foot... I just can't stand the
  current footsteps so we're gonna use these footsteps instead."*
  **m68 PROMISED THIS WOULD BE ONE LINE AND IT VERY NEARLY WAS.** That note stood the key up on
  its own so the swap would cost nothing (*"drop real footstep files at this key, `npm run bump`,
  and nothing else in the file moves"*) -- and what did have to move is the three numbers that
  only ever existed to rescue the stand-in, which is m63's rule and is the half a bare path swap
  would have got wrong.
  **THE STAND-IN WAS A BODY IMPACT, SO EVERY NUMBER ROUND IT WAS LIFTING ONE.** `hit_sound_gound_01`
  is a man arriving flat; three constants were bending it into a foot, and every one of them is
  now bending a foot:
      cut/att/dec   `dec` .09 stops the voice at `dec * 1.6` = **144 ms**. Measured off the real
                    files (an mp3 frame walk, which is a file read and not a probe): his are
                    **0.264 s and 0.288 s**, so the envelope was about to cut his recording in
                    HALF. Gone -- `SFX.edge` still trims the silence off the front, which is the
                    only trimming a real recording wants (m58's own sentence about `plasma_hit`)
      r0/r1 1.34 -> 1.12   a 34% pitch-up at a walk, on a file that IS a foot: a chipmunk boot.
                    **The IDEA is kept and the OFFSET goes** -- the same 1.20 ratio re-centred on
                    1, so heavier-is-lower still reads across his speed range and the middle of
                    that range is his own pitch. 1.09 -> .91
      alt .07       a shade of pitch standing in for a left foot and a right foot on ONE
                    recording. **There are two recordings.** 0, and `jit` stays, because two LEFT
                    steps in a row still must not be identical
  **AND WHICH FOOT PICKS THE FILE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THERE ARE TWO.** `p.stepL` and
  `d.stepL` have alternated since m64 and were only ever shading the RATE; `snd` has taken an
  explicit `o.i` since m58's `plasmaPick`, so the foot is an index and the bank is ordered
  [left, right]. **Keep it in that order** -- that ordering is the only thing saying which is
  which, exactly as `SFX.files.plasma` is lightest-first.
  **AND A ONE-BUFFER BANK FALLS BACK TO A RANDOM ROLL RATHER THAN SILENCING EVERY RIGHT FOOT.**
  `snd` does `const b = list[i]; if (!b) return 1;` -- so a failed decode, or a future single
  recording, would drop half his steps with nothing on screen to say so. The length is read off
  `SFX.buf.foot`, which is **the exact list `snd` indexes**, so it is not a second source of
  truth; and `SFX.buf` is `{}` at module scope, so this is safe long before audio is up.
  **AND `audio/footsteps` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- `readdirSync` is not recursive,
  so a new asset folder is a new entry there or every file in it goes stale silently. **TENTH
  time** across these repos, after `models/buildings`, `audio/plasma_sounds`, `models/towers`,
  `audio/alien_orc_grunt_sounds`, `audio/creature_noises`, `models/vehicles`, `models/streets`
  and Shredworld's own. The tell is always the same: the game asks for a path whose hash nobody
  wrote, so it fetches whatever that URL had before.
  **8.8 KB OF EACH 15 KB FILE IS ID3 TAG**, which is m58's finding arriving on a second bank and
  is worth nothing more than a sentence: the browser's `decodeAudioData` handles it perfectly
  well and there is nothing to fix in the asset. It is only `npm run sfx` (mpg123) that has to
  skip it, and it already does.
  **THE SURFACES ARE A STATED GAP, NOT A HOOK (m136).** *"I'm thinking about adding a few
  variations so walking on grass would sound different than walking on street would sound
  different than walking on something metal like a car."* That is a second axis on this bank and
  the honest blocker is that **nothing in this game records what he is standing on**: `groundAt`
  returns a HEIGHT, `triAdd` keeps a triangle and throws its source mesh's name away, and
  `resolveBoxes` answers about a box rather than about a material. Weirdport's collider has the
  names (`ground_asphalt_col`, the grass, the ramps) and the test site is a white floor with no
  answer at all. So the build is: carry a surface tag on the triangle and on the box, return it
  beside the height, and key the bank on it -- and **no line of it is written here**, because
  m95 is the build where a branch written for an empty hook short-circuited the good path the
  moment the clip landed. A branch that cannot fire yet is not a branch that works.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED:** whether his two recordings read as a stride at six a second, and
  whether `cut` should come back (it plays a file from its own 90% peak, which is right for an
  impact and would throw away a scuff on a recording that has one). `mel.STEP` is live --
  `r0`/`r1`, `g0`/`g1` and `jit` are the dials, and `mel.STEP.on = 0` is still the one word off.

- **THE WHITE THING IN THE BACKGROUND IS THE SUN SHAFTS, AND ALL THREE REASONS ONLY BECAME TRUE
  AT m138 (m139, `SHAFT.ahead`).** *"I don't know what this white thing we introduced is in the
  background."* Nine additive cards, and every one of the faults is a number nobody had ever been
  in a position to look at:
  1. **`gain` HAD NEVER ONCE DRAWN AT A VISIBLE OPACITY.** m130 typed .26 against a 57 deg sun,
     where `pow(camFwd . sunDir, 3.2)` tops out at .35 and the material therefore drew at
     **opacity 0.009** -- m135's own measurement, written down and not acted on. m133 brought the
     sun into the visible band and **m138 is the first build where the LIGHT agreed with it**, so
     the first frame in which .26 meant anything is the one in his screenshot. At the 12 deg
     sun's best case (.191), nine cards deep, the seam adds about **.4 linear on a sky already
     near .65** and it clips to white.
  2. **THE SET WAS CENTRED ON HIM AND EACH CARD IS 64 m LONG.** At a high sun that is right --
     the cards stand UP and you look through them. At 12 deg they LIE DOWN, so a card reaches
     ~32 m *behind* him past a lens only `CAM.dist` back: **a card through the near plane is a
     full-screen wash**, and nine of them converging on the sun's vanishing point is a bright
     wedge rising off the horizon, which is the shape in the shot. `ahead` 46 pushes the whole
     set along the sun axis (nearest card end at +3 m with `oy`'s own +/-12.8 spent), which is
     also what makes them read as light in the middle distance rather than as an object.
  3. **AND `toneMapped: false` MEANT THEY COULD NOT SHARE THE SKY'S HEADROOM.** Everything else
     rolls off through `NeutralToneMapping`; this alone went straight to the framebuffer, so it
     clipped exactly where the sky it sits on cannot. **That is the DUST's own m137 correction
     one effect over** -- additive against a bright sky has nowhere to go -- and it had been
     sitting in the shaft material since m130 unnoticed because the shafts were never visible.
  `gain` .12 with tone mapping on. **The SHAFTS key is the A/B** and it is what settles this in
  one tap, which is the whole reason m135 exists.
- **AND m137's DARK MOTE WAS MY CALL AND HE HAS TURNED IT DOWN (m139).** *"The little floating
  dust look like little football balls. I thought they would be white. They're like dark, just
  kind of odd."* Both halves are mine: the colour is m137's headroom argument (a mote DARKER than
  a bright sky is the one value that reads against both halves of this world) and the size is
  m138's answer to their being invisible at 1.2 px. **The argument is still sound and it is not
  what he wants to look at, which settles it** -- what a speck should look like is a taste
  question and those are his, which is this file's oldest standing rule about the settings panel.
  0xe9e2d4, size [.026, .062] (about 3 to 7 CSS px at 13 m -- specks, and still well over m99's
  threshold), alpha [.16, .50], `back` 2.2 -> 1.6 because a NEAR-WHITE mote taken to alpha 1 is a
  glare rather than a catch.
- **HIS OWN SKY IS IN, AND WHAT IT COSTS IS SAID RATHER THAN HIDDEN (m139, `SKY.src`).** *"Cost
  out the HDRI swap... I do wanna see that sky in there, the gray sky is just not very
  appealing."* `images/hdri_game.png` is **1774 x 887, 8-bit RGB, 2.3 MB on the wire and about
  8.4 MB resident** as RGBA with mips, against the generated gradient's 512 x 256 half-float:
  1 MB and **zero asset bytes**. Beside a 22 MB trim sheet neither is what costs frames, so the
  price is not memory:
  1. **AN 8-BIT SKY HAS NO SUN IN ITS IBL.** `sunK` puts the generated disc at **7x white** and
     the prefilter integrates that, which is what makes `scene.environment` a DIRECTION to bounce
     from. A PNG clamps at 1.0 -- **his brightest texel measures 0.999** -- so the IBL becomes a
     flat coloured dome. The directional `sun` does all the shaping and `envInt` is only .35 of
     bounce, so what is lost is small; it is lost all the same and **cannot be recovered from
     this side.** A real .hdr or .exr is the fix, and it is his to export.
  2. **THE EXPOSURE BELONGS TO THE IMAGE AND WAS MEASURED, NOT GUESSED** -- Shredworld's
     `npm run sky` rule, and this repo has no equivalent tool, so the PNG was decoded here
     (zlib + an un-filter pass) and integrated over the only band this camera can see. His sky
     reads **mean linear 0.336** across the horizon-to-16.4-deg band, warm pink at the horizon
     (.53 .27 .43) going deep blue overhead (.21 .19 .60) -- a dusk sky. The generated one reads
     **0.46** across that same band, so **`imgK` 1.35** lands it exactly where the fog, the
     palette and every other number were tuned. **Re-measure on every re-upload**: he repaints
     under the same filename and the exposure moves with it.
  3. **`colorSpace` GOES ON BEFORE `fromEquirectangular`, NEVER AFTER.** `TextureLoader` hands
     one back tagged linear and the prefilter reads the texture as it finds it, so every sRGB
     value would go in undecoded -- invisible on a dark sky and a white reflection on everything
     under a bright one. Shredworld's own landmine, first time it has been reachable here.
  **THE FOG'S COLOUR IS SAMPLED OFF THE PICTURE, NOT TYPED BESIDE IT.** `SKY.fog`'s whole
  argument is that a sky and the haze in front of it are ONE colour; with a gradient that is
  `SKY.hor` by construction and with a photograph it is a measurement -- **and it is averaged in
  LINEAR**, because an sRGB mean of a band running from bright sky to dark land lands a stop
  light and takes the saturation with it (the Portland vertex-colour lesson, one buffer over).
  **AND THE GRADIENT GOES UP FIRST, EVERY TIME.** 2.3 MB is not something to hold the first frame
  on and a session whose fetch fails still has to have a sky, so `skyBake` puts the generated one
  up at module scope and `skyLoad` re-bakes when the file lands -- the splash's own rule.
  **`skyApply` IS ONE PLACE, because the backdrop, the prefilter, the exposure and the fog are
  four things that must describe ONE sky** and two branches each doing all four is four chances
  for them to describe two. The exposure reaches `environmentIntensity` as well for exactly that
  reason: a picture and the light it casts must not be two different skies.
  **AND THE HDRI KEY READS WHETHER HIS SKY IS UP, NOT WHETHER IT WAS ASKED FOR** -- `src` is the
  request and `skyImg` is the file, so it is unlit while the fetch is out and unlit for ever if
  it never arrives, plus `NO SKY IMG` in the chip. *"Is that his sky"* stops being a comparison
  against a memory of the gradient. `mel.hdri(0)` is the same switch for a laptop.
- **THE METALLIC TAP IS ONE FILE, AND IT IS IN THE PAIR HE PREFERS (m139, `SFX.skipMax`).**
  *"There's this metallic tap dance noise... it's like every other one, like maybe it's one of
  the samples."* It is one of the samples and it is a LEFT one, which is what "every other"
  names. m138 evened the bank's gains and brought `footstep_2_l` down only **x0.718 (-2.9 dB)**,
  which was the loudness half; the other half is LENGTH and no gain can reach it.
  **`SFX.hit` .25 IS AN ONSET GATE FITTED AT m59 FOR IMPACTS**, where the quiet climb in front of
  the peak is a delay bolted onto a hit. On a recording whose peak is a sharp transient the
  reverse is true: a quarter of that peak sits WELL into the file, and the soft scuff in front of
  it -- which is the sound of a foot -- is thrown away. Measured at m138:
      footstep_2_l   opens at **0.144 s of 0.312** -- 46% discarded, 168 ms played
      the other three                                9-13% discarded, 230-262 ms played
  Loudest AND shortest is a TAP by construction. The cap is a fraction of the file's own length,
  so it **names nothing and is self-disarming**: it catches that one and is a no-op on every
  other file in the game. `SFX.skipMax` 0 is m138 exactly.
  **AND DROPPING THE FIRST PAIR WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED**, which is worth saying because he offered
  to: *"Do you wanna try the second ones that I did I uploaded instead."* **The outlier is in the
  second pair.** The first pair measures clean.
  **`npm run sfx` HAD TO BE TAUGHT THE NEW CONSTANT.** It lifts `sfxEdge` between the `EDGE:`
  markers and parses `SFX.hit`/`pre`/`punch` out of `index.html`; a key it does not know about
  arrives `undefined`, the cap never fires, and the tool measures a rule the game does not have.
  **This repo's oldest mistake, and the markers exist to prevent exactly it.**

- **A CAR WAS NOT A BOX, AND `if (q <= 0) continue` IS FALSE FOR NaN (m148, `c.cx`/`c.cz`).**
  *"This is what the game looks like... the main concern is everything is white."* The whole
  viewport below the HUD, pure white, with the chip still reading **48 FPS, 504 draw calls**,
  `0.0 m/s` and `land!` -- which is the diagnosis: the renderer is working perfectly and there
  is nothing in front of the camera, because **the camera is at NaN.**
  **`pushCars` HANDED A CAR TO `boxLocal`, AND `boxLocal` READS `b.cx` / `b.cz`.** A car carried
  `x`/`y`/`z`. So `dx = pos.x - undefined` is NaN, `_tcL.x` and `_tcL.z` are NaN, every extent
  is NaN, `q = Math.min(NaN, ...)` is NaN -- **and `if (q <= 0) continue` does not fire, because
  every comparison against NaN is false.** `pos.x += NaN` on the first frame a car came within
  eight metres, which in a city of 24 of them is immediately.
  **A GUARD WRITTEN AS "SKIP THE HARMLESS CASE" LETS THE POISONED ONE THROUGH.** `q <= 0` is the
  right test for a real number and the wrong shape for one that might not be; the version that
  is safe either way is `if (!(q > 0)) continue`. Worth knowing everywhere in this file a
  penetration, a distance or a dot is tested for being small.
  **AND IT WAS THE SAME TWO NAMES FOR ONE FACT, WHICH IS THIS FILE'S OLDEST SHAPE.** A car now
  carries `cx`, `cz`, `miny`, `maxy`, `cs`, `sn`, `hx`, `hz` -- **it IS a box**, so `boxLocal`,
  `boxNear`, `resolveBoxes`' own arithmetic and `bvBox` all read it with nothing translated.
  `TRAF.h` is its height, one number, so the collider and the view cannot disagree.
  **THE COLLIDER VIEW WAS CORRECT AND THAT IS WHY IT HID THIS.** `stepBoxView` built a literal
  (`{ cs, sn, cx: c.x, cz: c.z, ... }`) rather than passing the car, so the m147 probe drew the
  boxes in exactly the right places while the resolver read undefined off the same objects. **A
  view that restates the fields instead of passing the object is not drawing what is tested** --
  which is m128's own rule about a debug view being a second thing to be wrong, met from the
  other side. It is `bvBox(c, BOXV.car)` now.
  **AND NO GATE HERE CAN SEE IT**: `check:syntax` parses, `check:boot` never builds a car (every
  Weirdport GLB rejects headless), and `npm run jam`-style probes drive `stepTraffic` and not the
  player's resolver. A NaN in a position is invisible to everything in this container and is a
  WHITE SCREEN on the device, which is the one failure he cannot look at and correct.
- **THE OFFICER BORROWS THE BIKER'S GAIT AND WAS LOADED THIRTEEN LINES ABOVE HIM (m148).** The
  chip in that same screenshot read **`NO CLIP walk_fwd,run_fwd`**, and it has since m144:
  `DUMMY.borrow = BIKER` gave the officer a walk and a run he never had, and `buildDummies` runs
  BEFORE `buildBikers`, so `bodyBorrow` read `BIKER.P` as undefined, logged `skipped: no donor
  pose` to a console that does not exist on a phone, and every officer in the game has stood
  there with no gait ever since. **m144 wrote that ordering rule down for the CIVILS and did not
  apply it to the one borrower outside the loop.** The load moved below the donor.
  **AND THE NOTE NAMES THE BODY NOW.** `NO CLIP walk_fwd` is a fact about a CLIP and the question
  is always WHICH of seven kinds is standing there -- they name overlapping clips, so the string
  alone identified nobody and it cost a whole diagnosis to work out from the load order.
  `NO CLIP OFFICER:walk_fwd,run_fwd`.
- **THE DEBUG STACK IS FOLDED BY DEFAULT (m148).** *"That debug menu is still on screen."* m145
  built the fold -- it takes the chip's detail line, the world key, the collider key and the FX
  row -- and defaulted it OPEN, so the thing he asked to get out of the way was still the first
  thing on screen and the only way out was a tap he had to know about. **The build number never
  folds** and the key carries `+n` when `missing()` has something, so nothing that reports a
  fault is lost. His stored choice still wins, which is what makes an opinionated default safe.
- **THE CARS DRIVE, AND THE GRAPH IS DERIVED FROM HIS OWN EXPORT RATHER THAN AUTHORED (m147,
  `npm run lanes`, `WPLANES`, `TRAF`, `laneBuild`, `stepTraffic`, `pushCars`).** *"OK, what do we
  gotta do to make the cars driving? He said we gotta do something with Laney's baked."* That is
  my own m145 words coming back through the transcription -- **bake lanes** -- and the two ways
  out were "he authors named empties in Blender" or "we derive it from what is already there".
  This is the second, so there is nothing for him to do.
  **AND DRACO DECODES IN NODE, WHICH THIS FILE HAS SAID OTHERWISE NINE TIMES.** *"No harness in
  this repo can build a skin (draco wants a Worker)"* -- the Worker is THREE's packaging, not
  draco's. `vendor/draco/draco_wasm_wrapper.js` is an ordinary emscripten module and
  `DracoDecoderModule({ wasmBinary })` runs here perfectly well: the whole 510-node visual file
  decodes in **1.2 seconds**. (It has to be copied to a `.cjs` first -- the repo is
  `"type": "module"`, so node refuses to `require()` the vendored `.js` and hands back `{}`,
  silently.) That is the same shape as m131's correction that the COLLISION file is not draco:
  **a capability written down as absent stops being re-checked.** What is still true is that
  nothing here can build a SKIN -- that needs a mixer and a skeleton, not a decoder.
  **THE ROAD IS ASPHALT THAT NOTHING IS STANDING ON, AND THAT IS THE FINDING THAT MAKES ANY OF
  THIS POSSIBLE.** `ground_asphalt_col` is **EIGHT TRIANGLES** -- one 280 x 250 m slab under the
  entire slice -- and `vis_asphalt` is one merged primitive over the same box. The blocks, the
  sidewalks, the lots, the grass and the plazas are laid ON TOP of it. So "where is the road" is
  a TOP SURFACE question and not a mesh-name one, and there is no lane-line material to key on
  either: the collision file has exactly two materials, `collision` and `metal`.
  **AND A STREET'S WIDTH IS A RUN ACROSS IT.** Rasterise every up-facing ground triangle at 1 m,
  keep the highest per cell, and scan the road mask row by row: a run of 6 to 18 m is a street
  cross-section, so its MIDPOINT is a point on a centreline. Cluster the midpoints and the grid
  falls out. The width histogram is what says the reading is sound -- 10 to 12 m is far and away
  the commonest (424 of 709 runs one way, 545 of 1043 the other), which is what a downtown
  street is.
      4 N-S streets, 9 E-W segments, 19 junctions, 98 lanes, 3.7 km of lane
  **AND THE EIGHTEEN-METRE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF z = -24.5 IS THE DATA BEING RIGHT.** That street
  comes out as two segments with a gap between x -12 and +6, and the top surface there is
  `BK_Grass`: his Park Blocks, sitting in the middle of the street exactly as Portland's do. A
  car should not drive through a park, so the cut stays and the two halves are two streets.
  **WHAT IS BAKED IS THE MEASUREMENT AND NOT THE STRUCTURE.** 425 bytes -- thirteen rows saying
  where each street runs and how wide it is -- written into `index.html` between `LANES:` markers
  by the tool, so there is no new fetch, no new failure mode and no `DIRS` entry. The junctions,
  the graph, the lanes and the turns are derived by `laneBuild` at load, so **a bug in the graph
  is a code fix and not a re-bake**, and a re-export moves only those thirteen rows.
  **FORWARD IS LOCAL +X ON ALL FOUR CAR MODELS, AND IT WAS MEASURED TWICE RATHER THAN GUESSED.**
  The roof mass sits toward -X on every one of them (jeep -0.43 against a body centre of +0.03,
  weird van -0.85 / +0.32, hippie van -0.67 / -0.20, yellow cab -0.10 / +0.21), so the cabin is
  at -X and the bonnet at +X; and independently, of the 26 parked cars sitting clearly off a
  street's centreline and aligned with it, **19 keep RIGHT under that reading and 7 under the
  other**. Same answer twice, from an asset fact and from a placement fact.
  **AND IT JAMMED, AND THE FIRST FIX WAS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.** Driven headless over the shipped
  rule -- 24 cars, 180 s, the real graph -- the first version went 0 stopped to **19 of 24 and
  still climbing**, with one car stationary for 126 seconds. That is Shredworld's own signature
  read the other way: it grew monotonically, so a queue rather than a lock, and the queue had a
  lock at the head of it.
      v1  first come = whoever the array reached first     19/24 stopped, longest stop 126 s
      v2  + "you may not take a box you cannot leave"      19/24 stopped, longest stop 177 s
      v3  + a TOTAL ORDER on predicted arrival, and
          "you may not cross before the car in front"       **1/24, longest stop 16 s**
  **THE DIAGNOSIS IS WHAT MADE v3 THE RIGHT FIX AND IT WAS NOT A GUESS.** Dumped at t=90: *car 9
  owns node1 and is FOLLOWING car 13 at 9.8 m, and car 13 is WAITING for node1*. Both were on
  the SAME lane, car 13 six metres from the junction and car 9 sixteen -- so car 9 won the box
  because its id is lower, and then queued behind the car it had locked out. **Awarding a
  junction by loop order is not a rule, it is an accident**, and the fix is the one Shredworld
  already wrote down: first come, first served on PREDICTED ARRIVAL, ties on the lower id, which
  is arbitrary and TOTAL -- and a total order cannot close a cycle. Plus the clause that makes
  it airtight on one approach: **you may not cross before the car in front of you does.**
  **AND THE FAILSAFE IS A NET RATHER THAN A MECHANISM, WHICH IS MEASURED AND NOT ASSERTED.** A
  claim whose holder has been stationary for `TRAF.hold` is handed back. Over ten minutes at 24
  cars it **fires ZERO times**, and turning it off entirely (`hold: 999`) changes nothing -- so
  the two rules above are doing the work. It fires twice at 60 cars, which is congestion rather
  than a lock.
      24 cars, 600 s   mean 8.3 m/s of a 9.5 cruise   worst 7 stopped   longest stop 16 s
      40 cars          mean 7.2                       worst 13          32 s
      60 cars          mean 5.4                       worst 28          48 s -- a real jam
      12 cars          mean 9.0                       worst 2            4 s
  **AND NO TWO CROSSING CARS ARE EVER IN A BOX TOGETHER**, checked directly rather than argued:
  104 frames of 36,000 have a crossing pair inside a junction disc, and at 0.8 of that radius it
  is **zero** -- so all of it is one car leaving at the edge while another enters, which is the
  release threshold sitting exactly on the disc and not two cars meeting.
  **A CORNER IS AN ARC, BECAUSE THE TWO LANES DO NOT MEET.** Each lane is offset to the RIGHT of
  its own street, so a right turn ends at `node + offsetA` and starts again at `node + offsetB`
  -- three and a half metres away with the yaw a quarter turn round, and at a dead end's U-turn
  five metres and a half turn. As a bare state change that is a car teleporting at every single
  corner. A quadratic Bezier fixes it, and **its control point is where the two LANE LINES
  cross** -- the tangent of a quadratic at P0 is `P1 - P0` and at P2 is `P2 - P1`, so putting P1
  on both lines satisfies both ends at once; parallel lines (straight on, and the U-turn) have
  no crossing and take a point pushed out along A instead.
  **AND A BEZIER IS LONGER THAN ITS PARAMETER, WHICH IS A SPEED AND NOT A DETAIL.** `s` is the
  distance along the LANE, so a car covering `ds` of it covers `ds * stretch` on the ground --
  measured at **5.6x through a dead end's U-turn**, which is 0.55 m in one frame against 0.158 m
  at cruise. Eight samples give the curve's length and `arc.k` scales the speed cap by it, so
  what is capped is the GROUND speed. After: biggest one-frame move **0.298 m**, worst yaw step
  **4 degrees**, against 90 to 180 degrees before the arc existed.
  **AN ISLAND IS PRUNED RATHER THAN LEFT FOR A CAR TO FIND.** The far east stub of z = -111.5 is
  thirty metres that crosses nothing, so a car seeded there would shuttle on it for the whole
  session. Keep the largest connected component; a lane nobody can reach is not a lane.
  **AND A DEAD END IS A U-TURN, NOT A DESPAWN.** Most of the 23 are the edge of the slice, but
  two are interior -- the Park Blocks -- and a car vanishing beside a park reads as a bug where
  a car turning round reads as a car turning round.
  **THE MODELS ARE HIS OWN PARKED FLEET**, collected in `buildWpVisual` before the batch takes
  their nodes out of the scene: four bodies (a jeep, a weird van, a hippie van and a yellow cab)
  on one material, one primitive each -- so the whole driving fleet is **four InstancedMeshes and
  four draw calls** however many cars there are. Their half extents are measured off the
  geometry, never typed.
  **AND A CAR IS SOLID, THROUGH THE PLAYER'S OWN RESOLVER.** `pushCars` is m146's oriented-box
  push against a list handed over every frame, beside `pushBodies` on the same line -- one
  physics path, not two, and `cs`/`sn` are the same pair `wpOrient` writes and `boxLocal` reads,
  so the collider and the picture cannot disagree about which way a car is facing.
  **IT DOES NOT HIT HIM YET, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** Being launched by a bonnet
  is `carHit`'s own build (Shredworld has the worked version: the contact NORMAL picks the tier,
  only a nose can launch, and `preVx/preVz` have to be stashed before the resolver deletes the
  approach speed). Today a car shoves you out of the way and that is all.
  **AND `stepTraffic` RUNS ABOVE `stepDummies`**, `stepMoto`'s own ordering rule: the resolver is
  handed each car's box on the frame it is drawn at, so a fleet stepped after him is a fleet he
  is pushed out of one frame late -- sixteen centimetres of being shoved by a car that is no
  longer there.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `TRAF24/98` AND THE COLLIDER VIEW DRAWS THE GRAPH.** "The cars are not driving"
  is three bugs and one picture from a phone -- the graph came out empty, it came out and there
  are no cars on it, or they are driving somewhere he has not walked to -- and only the two
  numbers tell them apart, with `j<n>` on the end when cars are stopped. The COLLIDERS key draws
  every lane with an arrow head and every car as its turned box, **and the buffer reserves room
  for them rather than leaving it to the slack**: drawn after 700 static boxes they would be
  silently dropped, and the one view built to answer "is the graph right" would answer nothing.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** every Weirdport GLB rejects headless, so **`trafBuild` has
  never run in anything but a browser** -- whether the lanes sit on his tarmac rather than on a
  pavement, whether "right" reads as the right side of the road, and whether four car models at
  24 instances cost anything are device questions. What CAN be checked here was, by lifting the
  SHIPPED `laneBuild`/`lanePick`/`arcSet`/`stepTraffic` text and driving it: the graph, the
  connectivity, the jam, the junction exclusion and the frame-to-frame motion, all above.
  `mel.lanes()` prints the graph, `mel.lane(i)` puts him beside one, and `mel.TRAF` is live
  except `n` and `on`, which want a reload.
  **NOT DONE, AND HE SAID SO:** *"And can we make them drivable too maybe after."* Nothing here
  seats him in one.

- **EVERY VEHICLE COLLIDER WAS THE AXIS-ALIGNED BOX OF A ROTATED CAR, AND THE ORIENTATION WAS
  NEVER LOST -- ONLY MOVED (m146, `WP.turn`, `wpOrient`, `boxLocal`, `boxNear`).** *"The
  colliders for the cars in general are pretty big. The van's one is like skewed cockeye
  offset."* m129 measured it (55 vehicles, mean plan-area inflation **x1.28**, worst **x2.13**)
  and m131 fixed the OTHER half of the same complaint and wrote this one down as still open.
  **THE COLLISION FILE GENUINELY HAS NOTHING TO RECOVER, WHICH IS WHY `boxSkew` PASSES THEM.**
  All 55 car and van collision meshes read `boxSkew` **1.000** -- the export baked the AABB, so
  the geometry really is axis-aligned and m131's test is right to leave it alone. A 2.25 x 4.00
  car parked at an angle is a near-SQUARE 4.79 x 5.92 box, which is what reads as cockeyed
  rather than merely big.
  **IT IS STILL IN THE VISUAL, AND THE PAIRING IS EXACT.** 54 of the 55 pair to an `inst_car_*`
  / `inst_van_*` node at the same plan position to **0.0000 m** (the 55th is a freeway car with
  no instance within 34 m). Node transforms are never draco, and the collision GLB is plain
  glTF, so all of this is measurable offline against the real assets.
  **AND THE HALF EXTENTS FALL OUT OF THE AABB BY INVERSION.** `W = 2(hx|cos| + hz|sin|)` and
  `D = 2(hx|sin| + hz|cos|)` is two equations in two unknowns and solves whenever `|cos 2yaw|`
  is not zero. **The residual of an inversion is meaningless and was not trusted** -- it is
  confirmed by two facts the solve never sees:
      mesh 145 -> hx 2.000 hz 1.124   h 2.266      mesh 147 -> hx 2.250 hz 1.345   h 2.643
      mesh 146 -> hx 2.600 hz 1.421   h 2.454      mesh 148 -> hx 2.400 hz 1.438   h 2.535
  Twelve instances of mesh 145 at twelve different yaws, `det` from 0.68 to 1.0 and both signs,
  all solve to the same 2.000 x 1.124 -- and each group's HEIGHT, untouched by yaw and
  therefore an independent fingerprint, is constant with it. Four car bodies, four answers.
  **THE COLLIDER'S OWN DIMENSIONS ARE KEPT AND ONLY THEIR ORIENTATION CHANGES.** That is why
  the extents are solved rather than read off the visual geometry, which is the obvious move
  and is wrong: the visual is the whole TREE where the collider is a 0.7 m trunk box (m26's
  hack, which stays), so taking extents from the picture turns every tree into its canopy. What
  comes out is exactly the box he authored, turned the right way, and it can only ever SHRINK.
  **AND IT IS GENERAL RATHER THAN A CAR CASE, BECAUSE A SQUARE OVER-CLAIMS WORST.** A 0.70 m
  tree trunk at 45 degrees gets a 0.99 m box -- **x2.0** -- so the honest scope is "the AABB
  over-claims" and not "this is a vehicle". Measured through the shipped function over the real
  files: **195 of the 349 plain boxes**, and **1016.7 m2 of collider plan becomes 677.4** --
  a third of it was air. 42 families, every one a `prop_`: **zero buildings and zero `solid_`
  turned**, and the largest turned box is under 40 m2. Trees and bushes are 122 of them, so
  walking past a street tree gets easier, which is the change he will feel first.
  **A MIS-PAIR IS A NO-OP BY CONSTRUCTION**, which is what makes a 0.25 m snap safe: the only
  way to reach the write is for the paired node's yaw to make this box's OWN bounds over-claim
  by `min` 6%, so pairing onto a road slab or a wall (yaw 0, ratio 1) changes nothing at all.
  Two co-located instances -- a skylight's base and its glass -- share a transform, so which is
  picked cannot matter either.
  **AT EXACTLY 45 DEGREES THE AABB CARRIES NO INFORMATION AND IT SAYS SO.** `det` is `cos 2yaw`
  and the solve divides by it; at 45 the AABB of a rectangle is a square and cannot say which
  side is which, so the honest answer is to leave it square. The amplification is harmless well
  before that -- float32 bounds at `det` 0.005 give about 2e-4 m -- so the guard is 0.005 and
  **nothing in the city is currently skipped by it** (the worst real case is 46.7 degrees).
  **THE AABB IS LEFT ALONE AND STAYS THE BROAD PHASE**, which is what keeps this a narrow-phase
  change: `boxGrid` is already built when `wpOrient` runs, and a box that only ever shrinks is
  still correctly bucketed by the bounds it was bucketed with. Nothing about the grid, the
  queries or the overlap tests moves. `cs === undefined` IS the test, so every box nobody
  turned takes the exact line it always took.
  **FIVE READERS, ONE PRIMITIVE EACH, AND NOTHING RESTATED.** `boxLocal` is the rotation into
  the box's frame and `boxNear` is m89's closest-point-and-normal built on it:
      resolveBoxes   the same min-penetration test in the box's own frame -- he is a CIRCLE, so
                     his radius is rotation-invariant and only the axes change. **The push comes
                     back out along the box's REAL face normal**, which is what `foeMove` reads
                     as the wall it is sliding along (m145): against a car's phantom AABB that
                     normal was a face that is not there.
      groundAt       a turned box's roof is the roof of the CAR, not of the square round it
      camHit         the camera boom AND the bolt's flight -- Shredworld's c161 complaint one
                     shape along, where a shot aimed well past a car died in clear air
      wallFind /     one `boxNear` call each instead of one `clamp` each, so the face they pick
      ledgeFind      and the box the collider view draws are the same face
      bvBox          **draws the turned box, because the AABB is only the broad phase now** --
                     drawing it would be drawing the phantom rather than the thing the resolver
                     tests, which is the one mistake a debug view is not allowed to make
  **VERIFIED AGAINST THE REAL FILES BY RUNNING THE SHIPPED TEXT**, not a copy: every turned
  box's four corners lie inside the AABB it replaced (worst 1.4e-14 m), the turned box
  reproduces that AABB to 3.6e-15, `boxNear`'s normal always points away and its closest point
  is on the surface to 1.4e-14, and 4,680 points placed inside turned boxes all come OUT of
  `resolveBoxes`' oriented push with none left inside.
  **AND THE CHIP COUNTS THEM (`WP3684t/4104b/195y`).** *"The car colliders are still wrong"* is
  two bugs and one picture from a phone -- the pairing found nothing, or it found them and the
  box is still in the wrong place -- and only the count tells them apart. `y0` is the first.
  **STILL OPEN AND STATED:** `boxSkew` diverts a genuinely ROTATED collision mesh to the
  rasteriser (m131's two plaza rails, 121.86 skew), and now that a box can carry a yaw those
  would be better as one turned box than as a staircase of ten. `boxSkew` already sweeps for the
  tightest rectangle and knows its angle. That is a second change and this build moves one.
  `mel.WP.turn.on = 0` is m145 exactly and wants a reload.

- **THIRTY-SEVEN BODIES IN A CITY OF FOUR THOUSAND BOXES AND ONLY THE SIDEKICK HAD A STUCK
  DETECTOR (m145, `K.slide`, `foeSpot`, `STUCK`).** *"All the characters get stuck on stuff like
  buildings -- they're just constantly stuck walking into buildings. It needs a much more
  sophisticated state machine."*
  **m74 BUILT ALL OF THIS AND WROTE DOWN IN THE SAME BREATH THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF DONE.** Its
  own note: *"BOTH ARE GATED ON THE KIND'S OWN FIELDS, so the drunks are byte-for-byte unchanged
  -- a stuck drunk is a real bug too and it is a different build, not a free ride on this one."*
  `hop` and `give` are on `CLANCY` and on nothing else, so for nine builds **every warrior,
  drunk, hobo, skater, biker and civil has walked into walls with no detector, no give-up and
  no clear-spot test at all.** This is that build.
  **AND THE WALL'S NORMAL WAS ALREADY IN HAND -- THE PUSH-OUT *IS* IT.** `resolveBoxes` moves a
  body out of whatever it met along the shortest axis, so the difference between where he ASKED
  to be and where he ENDED UP is that face's outward normal. m63's flying body has read it
  exactly that way for its wall bounce since it was written; nothing is raycast and nothing is
  searched. That is the whole reason the slide is fifteen lines.
  **IT BENDS THE FACING AND THE TRAVEL FOLLOWS IT.** Sliding the TRAVEL alone is a walk cycle
  going sideways, which is the moonwalk this file refuses everywhere else -- so it is one more
  call to `faceTo`, still the one writer on `d.h`, and he comes round onto the wall at his own
  turn rate.
  **AND IT HAS TO TURN HIM HARDER THAN THE GOAL IS PULLING HIM BACK (`slide.turn` 2.2).** The
  caller ran `faceTo(goal)` a moment earlier in the SAME frame, so **two eases at the same rate
  pointing opposite ways cancel exactly** and he goes on walking into the wall -- the bug this
  build is about, reintroduced by the fix for it. Caught by reading the composition rather than
  by running it. At 2.2 the net is 1.2x his own turn rate onto the tangent.
  **THE LATCH IS REFRESHED WHILE HE IS STILL PRESSED, AND THE SIDE IS KEPT.** Picking the
  tangent fresh from the goal each frame is a man at an inside corner flipping between its two
  ends for ever; agreeing with the direction he is ALREADY sliding follows the wall round a
  corner and there is nothing left to flip -- `LOCK.keep`'s hysteresis argument, one system
  over. It releases by itself: the moment nothing pushes him the clock runs down over `hold`,
  which is what carries him clear of the corner before the goal takes him back.
  **AND THE ESCALATION FALLS OUT OF THE NUMBERS RATHER THAN BEING A STATE MACHINE.** `slide.at`
  .25 is under CLANCY's `hop.at` .55 and far under `give` 1.6, and **sliding MOVES him**, so
  `stuckT` decays at twice its build rate the whole time: a slide that is working never reaches
  the hop or the give-up underneath it, and one that is not (an inside corner, both tangents
  blocked) reaches both, in order, with nothing written to sequence them.
  **AND THE ROAM POINT HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED AGAINST ANYTHING (`foeSpot`, `roamTry`).** That is
  the other half and probably the bigger one: on the test site a point inside one of ten boxes
  is rare and the give-up covers it, and **in a city most of a fourteen-metre ring is BUILDING**
  -- so a body spent his life walking at a place inside a wall, grinding there until `give`
  re-rolled him at another one. Six darts, first clear one wins, **last one kept whatever it
  reads** -- a FIXED count and never a rejection loop, which is unbounded and which inside the
  frame over 4,104 boxes is a hitch nobody can explain. Worst case is exactly the old behaviour
  with the slide and the give-up still underneath it.
  **IT IS THE COLLIDER'S OWN ANSWER, NOT A SECOND RULE** -- the same radius and the same height
  `foeMove` resolves against, so a spot it accepts is one his own body agrees it can occupy.
  m127's `wpStand` is the same sentence for the spawn sweep and **cannot be reused**: it is
  built on `triGround`, which the test site has not got.
  **THE HOP IS DELIBERATELY NOT GIVEN TO THE OTHERS.** A 0.576 m apex is for the KERB it was
  measured against, a man hopping at a building reads as flailing, and `K.clips.jump` is absent
  on every one of these kinds -- so it would play the IDLE clip floating upward, which is worse
  than the thing it is fixing. The slide is the answer for a wall; the hop stays the answer for
  a kerb, on the one body that has a pose for it.
  **A DEFAULTS MERGE RATHER THAN SEVEN ROWS**, with `if (K[k] === undefined)` so a table that
  names its own still wins (CLANCY keeps the `give` he has had since m74). **And it runs AFTER
  `CIVILS`, which is not tidiness**: `civil()` builds each row with `Object.assign({}, CIVIL,
  ...)`, so CIVIL's fields are COPIED at build time and anything written to CIVIL afterwards
  never reaches them -- the rows are in the list for that reason.
  **AND THE CHIP COUNTS BOTH (`S3/2`).** *"They're just constantly stuck"* is three bugs and one
  picture from a phone -- the slide never fired, it fired and did not help, or they were never
  stuck and it is the roam point -- and only those two numbers tell them apart. Silent when
  nobody is stuck.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** there is no GPU here and no way to step thirty-seven bodies
  through the real Weirdport collider outside a browser, so **whether a body actually rounds a
  corner rather than shuffling along one wall for ever is a device question.** Both gates pass.
  `mel.STUCK` is the table, `mel.FOE.slide = null` turns it off on one kind, and `roamTry: 1` is
  the old picker exactly.
- **THE DEBUG STACK FOLDS AWAY, AND `hudGutter` HAD TO BECOME A FUNCTION FOR IT (m145,
  `#chipMin`).** *"The debug panel takes up a lot of the screen -- it can have a minimize
  button."* Five things in that corner between them: the chip's detail line (two or three lines
  on his phone), the world key, the collider key and the nine-segment FX row.
  **THE BUILD NUMBER NEVER FOLDS**, because *"which build is he actually looking at"* is half of
  every boot question and the card is over the badge for the whole load -- so what is left
  minimized is the one thing worth keeping.
  **IT IS A KEY BESIDE THE NUMBER RATHER THAN A SECOND TAP ON IT.** That tap is spent (m104's
  pad float), and a gesture meaning two things depending on how long it is held is a mode you
  can be in without knowing it -- the argument that killed every hidden gesture in this file.
  **`hudGutter` IS A FUNCTION NOW, BECAUSE TWO THINGS MOVE THE CHIP'S HEIGHT.** m128 measured it
  inside the chip update, which was right while the only thing that changed the height was the
  TEXT; folding the detail line changes it too, and a second copy of that arithmetic is two
  places to disagree about where the gutter is -- **which is the exact fault m128 exists to have
  fixed.** One function, two callers.
  **AND THE FOLD FORCES A RE-MEASURE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE TEXT TO MOVE.** The line
  changes most frames (the fps digit, the speed) so it would come right on its own -- most of
  the time. Standing still at a steady frame rate it would not, and the keys would sit where the
  OTHER state put them: a key on top of the chip, or a gap where the chip used to be.
  **AND THE MINIMIZED KEY CARRIES THE MISSING COUNT.** Folded away, `missing()` is the one thing
  on that line he cannot afford to lose -- `NO COLIN GLB` and `LOST n CHUNKS` are exactly the
  reports a phone has no other way to make. `+3` is not the message and is not meant to be: it
  says there IS one, and the tap that reads it is already under his thumb.
  **AND IT IS REMEMBERED, because he reloads for every single build** -- a fold he has to re-tap
  on each one is a fold that does not work.

- **SIX RIGS WITH NO CLIPS WEAR THE BIKER'S, AND THE RETARGET WAS ALREADY WRITTEN (m143, `CIVIL`,
  `civil`, `CIVILS`, `retarget`, `bodyBorrow`, `buildCivil`, `K.borrow`, `K.hRel`).** *"Let's go
  ahead and put all the new characters in the games. None of them have animations but they're
  rigged with mixamo rig so they can borrow animations."*
  **HE IS RIGHT ABOUT BOTH HALVES AND THE FILES SAY SO**, read out of their own JSON chunks --
  animation samplers and node transforms are never draco, so all of this is answerable here even
  though nothing in this container can build a skin:
      all six      0 clips, 1 skinned mesh, soles at exactly y = 0, toes +Z (0.00 deg),
                   no weapon mounts, and the COMPLETE 65-joint set `hobo_01` has, missing nothing
      fat_activist_01  65 joints     the other five  66 (+ a `root` null)
      rest-pose offset vs `fat_biker_02`  worst **0.04 deg**, which is export rounding
  **THE `root` BONE IS THE ONLY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE AND IT IS m119's, EXACTLY.** They fall into
  the two families this file already knows: `Armature[0.01] > Hips` with the -90 X in the Hips'
  own local, and `Armature[0.01] > root > Hips` with it in `root`. Same net world rotation either
  way, so a retarget across them is ONE constant rotation at the Hips.
  **AND HE MOVED ONE OF THEM MID-BUILD, WHICH IS THE POINT.** `fat_hipster` was measured in the
  donor's family and re-exported an hour later with a `root` null, taking its delta from 0.00 deg
  to 90.00. **Nothing in the code changed and nothing needed to** -- the delta is measured off the
  two bind poses rather than typed, so the only thing that went stale is the table of numbers in
  this note. That is the right thing to have to update, and re-running the measurement after his
  push is what caught it; the re-export also needed `npm run bump m143` to move its content hash,
  or the phone would have gone on serving the copy it already had.
  **`fat_biker_02` IS THE DONOR AND IT IS NOT THE HOBO**, which is the one real design call here.
  Measured per clip, bones moving past 2 degrees:
      hobo_01 `idle`             **2 bones, 2.1 deg** -- a statue, so his idle is `drunk_idle`
      fat_biker_02 `idle`        33 bones, 18.9 -- a man standing about
      fat_biker_02 `idle_fan_self`  49 bones, 86.2 -- a real flourish, which is what `look` is for
  So the hobo's thirty are a DRUNK's set, and a secret service agent stumbling like a drunk is a
  worse answer than no clips at all. The biker's sixteen are the complete SOBER civilian set --
  idle, a flourish, walk, run, in-air, three hit reactions, one fall, one get-up -- **on a FAT
  rig, which is what all six of these are.** The three DRIVING clips are deliberately left out:
  only `buildBikers` seats a rider, and `bodyLoops` would otherwise put three held poses in the
  loop set for a body that can never reach them.
  **AND THE RETARGET IS AN EXTRACTION, NOT A SECOND COPY.** `mphBorrow` has done rotation-only
  Mixamo retargeting since m119 and it was correct; what changed is that there is now a SECOND
  caller, which is `bodyLaunch`'s own rule (m96) -- the thing that motivates an extraction is a
  second caller, not tidiness. `retarget(S, T, clips, bones)` is numbers in and clips out: it
  knows nothing about a mixer, an action table or whose body it is, and `mphBorrow` is what is
  left over once it is gone.
  **THE ARITHMETIC IS EXACT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED.** The delta, `k` and the track rewrite
  run offline over `walk_fwd`'s real 26-key Hips track, compared as WORLD transforms on the
  target against the donor's:
      activist  D  0.00 deg  k .9137      hipster  D 90.00 deg  k 1.0136
      biker_01  D 90.00      k .9670      secret   D 90.00      k .9391
      hippie    D 90.00      k .9677      trump    D 90.00      k .9043
      world ROTATION error **0.0e+0 on every key of all six**; world POSITION error ~1e-6 units
  The two families fall out exactly as the bind poses predict, which is the single-delta form
  being provably right rather than plausible.
  **IT PRODUCES `P.clips`, WHICH IS WHY NOTHING ELSE CHANGED.** `bodySpawn` builds its actions off
  that list, and the bolt, the swept limb, `bodyFly`, `bodySep`, `dummyBlow`, the player's own
  resolver and `foeWander` all reach anything in `DUMMIES`. **`d.K`'s dividend for the seventh
  time: a table and a load line.** And it runs BEFORE the de-drift and before the log, so the
  printed count is the count he ends up with -- the de-drift is then a proven no-op, because the
  donor's own `bodyProto` already ran it.
  **THE NON-HIPS TRACKS ARE SHARED WITH THE DONOR, NOT COPIED.** The one thing in this file that
  MUTATES a track is `deDrift`, and it touches only Hips `.position` -- which `retarget` always
  replaces with a fresh array on a fresh track. Nothing shared is ever written to.
  **ONE TABLE, SIX ROWS, AND A ROW IS A FILE AND A PLACE.** Six near-identical tables is six
  things to keep in step, which is this file's oldest standing complaint; the height comes out of
  `hRel`, the clips out of `borrow`, and **the reference speeds are WRITTEN by the borrow** from
  the donor's measured pair scaled by the height ratio -- `mphBorrow`'s own `gaitK`, because a
  reference is authored travel times the scale the model is drawn at. A number copied six times
  is six things to keep in step with a measurement that lives somewhere else.
  **AND `K.hRel` IS A PROPORTION RATHER THAN SIX TYPED HEIGHTS** -- as tall as the donor, in the
  ratio the two exports were DRAWN in, so a re-export at any size lands right with no edit:
      activist 1.78   biker_01 1.76   hippie 1.71   hipster 1.73   secret 1.59   trump 1.59
  19 cm across the six, which reads as six people rather than six copies at one height.
  **THE CONFOUND IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN**: every export here is normalised so its authored
  X span is exactly 1.000, which is the ARM SPAN in an A-pose -- so a FATTER body, whose arms
  cannot come as close in, reads as slightly shorter than it is. Two independent skeletal measures
  (the head bone's height, the hips bone's) agree on the ORDER, so the ranking is real; how much
  of the 19 cm is girth rather than height is **not knowable from this side**. `hRel: 0` draws all
  six at the donor's height and is read at BUILD time, so it wants a reload.
  **PLACED BY FARTHEST-POINT SEEDED WITH THE BODIES ALREADY ON THE STREET (m60/m80).** Seeding the
  spread with the nineteen already out there is what puts these six in the GAPS rather than in a
  rank of their own -- checked as rectangles against all fourteen boxes, both buildings, the
  motorcycle's lane and every existing body. Worst clearance **2.55 m** against a body radius of
  .42, all six 16 to 27 m out. **A plain farthest-point run over the whole square went straight to
  the corners** (every spot at 31-32 m, which is the void rather than the test site) -- m80's own
  lesson, made again and caught by looking at the numbers before typing them.
  **AND WEIRDPORT'S CROWD IS ONE NUMBER, NOT SIX KEYS.** `WP.crowd.CIVIL` is per KIND and
  `wpPopulate` expands it, so a seventh civil needs no edit there -- six strings keyed by name
  would be six more things to keep in step with `CIVILS`.
  **THEY ARE DNA-WEARABLE FOR FREE**, which is `dnaOK`'s own structural rule collecting: that test
  is `K.P && clips.idle && clips.walk && clips.run`, so the moment the borrow gives them a gait
  they can be worn, with nothing said about them anywhere in `MORPH`.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** there is no GPU here and no harness in this repo can build a
  skin (draco wants a Worker), so **whether they stand up in the borrowed clips is a device
  question** -- the arithmetic that CAN be checked is above and was. "The street is full of
  statues" is three bugs and one picture from a phone (the donor never arrived, a limb is missing,
  the bind pose is too far off), so all three warn to the console AND say `NO CLIPS <name>` in the
  chip. `mel.CIVILS` is live.

- **HIS EAR WAS RIGHT AND HIS MECHANISM WAS NOT, AND THE CLICK WAS MINE FROM m140 (m142,
  `bankLead`).** *"I jumped up in the air and landed on the ground and it made a noise when I hit
  the ground, and I think that might be the noise that's playing over and over when I run --
  is it possible it's firing when I run even though it's the noise that's supposed to fire when
  you hit the ground?"*
  **THE LANDING CANNOT FIRE WHILE RUNNING, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS FLAT.** `bumpSnd` is gated on
  `BODYSND.drop.at` 3 against the player's own `me` .72, so it needs an impact of **4.17 m/s** --
  which at `MOVE.g` 20 is **0.43 m of free fall over 0.21 s** -- and going airborne at all needs
  the ground to drop away by more than `MOVE.step` **0.357 m** in a frame. So a kerb is silent
  and a run on the flat can never reach it, which is exactly what that field's comment claims
  and, unlike several claims in this file, the numbers back it. `integrate` also has four call
  sites and they are mutually exclusive branches, so it runs once a frame and cannot double-fire.
  **BUT THE TWO SOUNDS REALLY HAD CONVERGED, AND m140 IS WHY.** `align` opened each footstep
  `SFX.lead` **12 ms** before its own `e.p`, which is nearly what `cut` does to the LANDING bank
  (it opens AT `e.p`) -- so a foot recording was being played from ON its transient with the
  whole soft approach discarded. Measured, RMS over the first 25 ms of the window actually
  played, through the SHIPPED `sfxEdge`:
      m137, opening at `e.a`        .0220  .0121  .0769  .0400   and 48-142 ms of spread
      m140-m141, lead 12 ms         .1468  .1489  .1542  .1382   **1.9x to 12.3x harder**
      the LANDING bank on `cut`     .3723  .3123
  That took a footstep from 15-to-30 times softer than a landing to about **two**, uniformly on
  all four. **A uniform hard front IS what a metallic click is**, and it is a consequence of m140
  I did not think about.
  **THE ALIGNMENT IS NOT THE FAULT AND MUST NOT BE REVERTED.** It is what removed the 94 ms
  spread, which was the rhythm half of this and is still fixed. What was wrong is only how far
  before the peak it opens -- **one number, at the wrong end of a trade with two sides**: too
  short and the file opens on its transient, too long and it hits the floor of `e.a` on whichever
  recording has the least run-up, at which point that one opens earlier than the rest and the
  spread comes straight back.
  **SO THE LEAD IS MEASURED PER BANK AND `SFX.lead` IS ONLY A CEILING OVER IT.** The right value
  is the largest lead EVERY file can take, which is the smallest `e.p - e.a` in the bank -- a
  property of the recordings rather than a taste call. Headroom reads 37 / 50 / **30** / 101 ms,
  so `bankLead(foot)` resolves to **30 ms**, set by `footstep_2_l`:
      lead 12ms   spread 0ms    .1468 .1489 .1542 .1382   <- the click
      lead 30ms   spread 0ms    .0312 .0687 .0769 .0662   <- back inside the m137 band
      lead 60ms   spread 30ms   .0220 .0121 .0769 .0717   <- the ceiling alone, unmeasured
  The ceiling is 60 **on purpose**, over the asset's own limit, so what binds is the recordings
  and a fifth pair with less run-up moves the answer by itself. **A typed 30 would go stale the
  next time he adds a pair, silently** -- which is the class this file keeps paying for, and he
  has already said he will make a few more.
  **AND IT HAS TO BE A BANK NUMBER RATHER THAN A FILE NUMBER**, or files with different headroom
  get different leads and the alignment -- the whole point -- is gone. **Recomputed while the
  bank is still arriving**, because buffers decode asynchronously and the first seconds of a
  session legitimately have only some of them (`sample()`'s rule, one repo over), with the
  ceiling in the cache key so `mel.SFX.lead` is not a dead dial.
  **`mel.SFX.lead = .012` IS THE A/B STRAIGHT BACK TO WHAT HE IS HEARING**, which is the one
  thing that settles this on the phone rather than here.
  **THIS IS THE FOURTH PASS AT THE FOOTSTEPS AND THE THIRD OF MY OWN FIXES TO BE WRONG** -- m138
  evened the gains, m139 capped the onset skip (and made the worst file worse), m140 aligned them
  and made all four click. Each was on a real axis and only m140's was the rhythm. The thing that
  has now worked twice is measuring the window the game ACTUALLY plays rather than the file.
- **THE PAINTED PASSES, PORTED (m141, `TOON`/`toonPatch`, `PAINT`/`paintPatch`, the TOON and
  PAINT keys).** *"I need to figure out how to get this game more painted and then settle on a
  painted style, because the procedural kind of blender environment mixed with -- that's not
  painted -- and then the characters being like nice textures and painted, they kind of
  clash."* Then: *"do the painted style port."*
  **THE VENDORED three IS BYTE-IDENTICAL TO SHREDWORLD'S** -- md5 `f5156dd8` on `three.core.min
  .js` and `55ff257d` on `three.module.min.js`, both files, both repos -- so every splice target
  is guaranteed to match here exactly as it does there. **That is the one thing about a shader
  port that fails SILENTLY and the one thing no gate in this container can check**, and it was
  checked by reading the build rather than by arguing: the two lighting-chain targets exist
  byte-exact inside `lights_physical_pars_fragment` (one occurrence, tabs and all) and all six
  includes the two patches replace are present.
  **TWO PASSES, AND THE PAINT'S TRICK IS THE THRESHOLD RATHER THAN THE NOISE.** Noise added to a
  colour reads as DIRT. A painted surface is areas of ONE FLAT COLOUR with a drawn line where two
  of them meet -- so the broad noise is thresholded into patches and **the band between them is
  DARKENED**. That seam is the ink and it is the single thing that makes this read as paint.
  **MEASURED ON THE SHIPPED `paintBake`, which is the half a headless box can answer**: of 65,536
  texels, **78.0% flat dark, 18.9% flat light, 3.1% transition**, with the ink channel near zero
  everywhere but those seams. A tile that came back SMOOTH would be mottling.
  **AND IT IS NOT SYMMETRIC** -- a net darkening of about 9% of `patch` over a surface. Left
  verbatim, because the ported parts are the ones that are right and my additions are the first
  suspects (c101's rule, twice over); stated because on a world this pale it is the thing to
  notice first, and `PAINT.patch` is the dial.
  **THE RAMP SHAPES THE DIFFUSE ONLY, AND THAT IS FOURTEEN BUILDS RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE.**
  three's Smith visibility ends `0.5 / max( gv + gl, EPSILON )` and both terms carry a factor of
  dotNV or dotNL, so on a silhouette both go to zero, the denominator collapses onto EPSILON
  (1e-6) and V comes back near half a million. Stock three cancels it exactly, because the same
  dotNL multiplies the irradiance in front of it. **Substitute a ramp into the ONE dotNL feeding
  BOTH lobes and that cancellation is gone**: where the true dotNL was zero the irradiance is
  still `floor` of full sun while the visibility term has already exploded, which is a red
  one-pixel contour tracing every curved silhouette in the game. `irradianceToon` is added
  ALONGSIDE `irradiance` and only the DIFFUSE line reads it, with a hard `min(..., 4.0)` on both
  specular accumulators underneath -- **and that ceiling stays live at `on: 0`**, because it
  costs nothing and no highlight here is worth eight times the sun.
  **THE BLOCKER WAS THE TWO INSTANCE HOOKS AND IT IS WHY THIS IS NOT ONE LINE.** An instance
  `onBeforeCompile` SHADOWS the prototype's completely, and melee has exactly two -- `hueGlow`
  (the alien and both weapons) and the City_Trim tint (the whole of downtown). A bare prototype
  patch would paint the roads, the ground, the props and the vehicles and leave the WEAPONS and
  the BUILDINGS out, which is a partial application that reads as a bug rather than as a style.
  Both call the patches themselves now.
  **AND THE TINT IS PATCHED LAST SO IT ENDS UP FIRST IN THE SHADER.** It and the paint both
  replace `#include <color_fragment>`, and the colour has to be settled before the paint splotches
  it -- otherwise every patch edge is a different hue from its neighbour. Shredworld's own
  ordering rule between `palPatch` and `paintPatch`, one pass along.
  **A CHARACTER IS SHADED, NOT PAINTED, AND THAT IS THE MIXED-MEDIA READ HE ASKED FOR.** A
  threshold pass over a face is dirt. Every character material sets `userData.noPaint` --
  `bodyProto`, `buildShe` and `hueGlow` -- and still takes the ramp. **`noPaint` is in the
  program cache key**, so a material that had already compiled needs `needsUpdate` or it keeps
  the painted shader it was given.
  **TWO KEYS, NOT ONE, AND BOTH OFF BY DEFAULT.** A style question can only be settled on the
  phone and each toggle has to move ONE variable or neither can be judged -- the settings
  panel's own rule, and the reason `mel.tint(1)` was worth nothing until m135 gave it a key.
  **AND NEITHER PRESS RECOMPILES ANYTHING**: `uToonK` at 0 makes `toonRamp` return its own
  argument and takes the rim to zero, `uPaintK` at 0 skips the block, so unlike the IBL key
  there is no hitch and the frame after a press is the frame before it.
  **THE TWO DEFAULTS THAT DEVIATE FROM SHREDWORLD ARE ABOUT THIS GAME'S LIGHTING, AND THEY ARE
  DIALS RATHER THAN FINDINGS.** The ramp shapes DIRECT light only, and melee runs hemi 1.75 +
  fill 0.85 against a sun of 2.4 where Shredworld runs sun 3.4 against hemi 1.6 -- so a much
  larger share of every surface here is ambient and the bands have less to bite on. `floor`
  .40 -> .28 gives the ramp more range; `rim` .54 -> .24 because a white rim on a white wall
  under a pale sky is either invisible or mud.
  **AND FLAT AND TOON PULL OPPOSITE WAYS.** FLAT cuts the directional by 70%, which is exactly
  the term the ramp quantises, so the two together read as almost no bands. One at a time.
  **WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE IS THE PALETTE PASS.** Shredworld's `palPatch` is a third
  thing -- a hue-vs-hue curve pulling every primary toward a sampled art palette -- and he has
  just turned the vertex TINT off with *"it's a little too colorful"*. Shipping a colour remap
  in the same build as the thing it would be judged against is two variables at once.
  **AND THERE IS NO ROAD DIAL.** Shredworld's `PAINT.road` rides an `aRoad` vertex attribute its
  own city bake writes; nothing in melee's geometry carries one, and a declared attribute nobody
  supplies is a stale generic waiting to happen (three SKIPS a missing attribute rather than
  zeroing it). One dial.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** there is no GPU here, so **whether any of it looks painted is
  a device question** and so are both deviating defaults. What CAN be checked was: both gates
  pass, every splice target exists byte-exact in the vendored build, and the baked tile is
  provably bimodal. `mel.toon()` / `mel.paint()` are the switches and `mel.TOON` / `mel.PAINT`
  are live -- every number in them is read every frame, and the tile is re-baked only when one
  of the three things it actually depends on has moved.
- **THE FOOTSTEPS ARE A RHYTHM WITH TWO CLOCKS IN IT, AND BOTH EARLIER FIXES WERE ON THE WRONG
  AXIS (m140, `SFX.lead`, `snd`'s `align`).** *"The footsteps still kill me and I don't even know
  what to do about that. There's like this metallic click sound."* Third report, and the first
  one that was measured rather than reasoned about -- m138 evened the bank's GAINS and m139
  capped how much of a file the onset gate may discard, and neither touched what is wrong.
  **WHERE THE FOOTFALL ACTUALLY SITS IN EACH FILE, AND HOW LATE THE GAME THEREFORE PLAYS IT:**
      footstep_l     event at  70 ms of 264 ms   ->  played  48 ms after the trigger
      footstep_r                79 ms of 288                 53 ms
      footstep_2_l             174 ms of 312                **142 ms**
      footstep_2_r             139 ms of 288                 112 ms
  **A 94 ms SPREAD ACROSS FOUR FILES THAT ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR ONE EVENT.** At a sprint a
  footfall is about 167 ms, so that is more than half a step interval -- and the pair is rolled
  per footfall (m137), so roughly every other step lands late. *"I can hear the nice footsteps
  but there's like a tap too... it's like every other one."* **His sentence is two events
  because there ARE two events**, and neither is metallic: it is one sound on the beat and one
  a tenth of a second behind it.
  **AND m139 MADE THE WORST ONE WORSE.** `SFX.hit` .25 had found `footstep_2_l`'s event at
  144 ms; `skipMax` overruled it back to 62 and put 80 ms of lead-in back. **The gate was
  right and the cap was a fix for a diagnosis that was wrong.** That constant is gone -- m63's
  rule, that a number which exists to rescue a mistake goes when the mistake does.
  **THE FIX IS AN ALIGNMENT, NOT A TRIM.** An `align` call starts `SFX.lead` before the file's
  OWN peak (`e.p`, which `cut` has measured since m59), so every file in the bank puts its event
  at the same offset from the trigger **by construction**: 12 / 15 / 12 / 12 ms. That is
  `SFX.even`'s argument one axis over -- **how loud and how DELAYED a recording is, is where it
  happened to be cut rather than a decision anybody made about the game.**
  **AND IT REACHES A PRE-TAP NO GATE COULD.** `footstep_2_r` carries a real second transient at
  65 ms, **70 ms in front of its footfall, at 35% of peak** -- so the onset gate latches onto
  THAT and can never help however it is tuned. Aligned, the window opens past it. `footstep_r`
  has seven transients and is a scuffy multi-contact step, which is fine and is in one file.
  **`align` IS NOT `cut`.** That one starts AT the peak, which is right for an impact and throws
  a foot's attack away. 12 ms keeps it.
  **AND `att` HAD TO WORK WITHOUT `dec`.** The aligned window opens at 11 to 17 per cent of peak,
  and a gain that STEPS onto that is a click -- which is the very thing this build removes. Three
  milliseconds, inaudible, and there is nothing left to step.
  **THE NUMBER THAT NAMES THIS HAS BEEN IN `npm run sfx` SINCE m59 AND WAS READ AS SOMETHING
  ELSE.** The `skip` column is the lead-in; it was framed per file as *how much swell sits in
  front of the punch*, for LOUDNESS. Across a bank it is a timing spread, and nobody had ever
  looked at it that way. It prints the per-bank spread now. **It only matters for a bank that
  plays as a RHYTHM and the tool cannot know which one does** -- `plasma_sounds` spreads 77 ms
  and is right to, because `plasmaPick` ranks it by intensity and LENGTH is a term in that.
  **AND THAT TOOL WAS MEASURING TWO RULES THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE.** Its default folder list was
  `['audio', 'audio/plasma_sounds']`, typed at m58 -- so the footsteps, the jetpack, the orc
  grunts and the creature noises have never once been in a default run. Derived now, which is
  `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS` tax and the eleventh time it has been paid. And a bare `/^\s*lead:/m`
  found **`HURT.lead` .92** four hundred lines earlier, so the first report read *"align puts
  every one at 920 ms"*. **A field name is not unique in a file this size**; the constants are
  read out of the `SFX` block now. Both are the mistake the `EDGE:` markers exist to prevent,
  made one line outside them.
- **THE TINT KEY COULD NOT REACH THE STATE ITS LABEL NAMES (m140, `WP.tintMode`).** *"I'm
  thinking tint off, it's a little too colorful."* `tintLin` was a COLOUR SPACE switch (m126):
  the tint applied either way and the key only chose raw linear against `pow(c, 2.2)` -- so
  **"tint off" was not a state the key had**, and the unlit one he was looking at is the MORE
  colourful of the two, because `pow` on a value under 1 darkens and desaturates. **A control
  whose label names something it cannot do is worse than no control**, which is this file's own
  sentence about `mel.boxes()` being buried on badge tap twelve.
  Three states: 0 off, 1 raw (m125's shipped), 2 sRGB. **The key is OFF/2 and defaults off** --
  his preset, and 2 rather than 1 because he has already said the raw one is too much. One
  uniform, so all three are an A/B on the phone with no recompile: `mel.tint(0|1|2)`.
- **HIS PRESET IS THE DEFAULT NOW (m140).** *"I think sun at 30, IBL, dust, HDRI, and I'm
  thinking tint off."* SUN 30 is `SUNC.i` 1 **and the initial `sun.position`**, because `sunSet`
  is only ever called from the key -- moving the index alone would have left the light at 12
  with the key reading 12 and the first press cycling to 57. Same bearing and same length
  (L 14.32, so the shadow box and `stepSun`'s offset are untouched); only the pitch moves, and
  `skyBake`'s own check still reads **sun dot 1.000**.
- **FLAT IS LOW CONTRAST, AND IT IS NOT SOLD AS PAINTED (m140, `FLAT`, `flatSet`).** *"I kinda
  like almost like sun off -- it just gives it a more flat look and I kinda like the flat look.
  I feel like we're mixing styles right now... the procedural Blender environment mixed with the
  characters being nice textures and painted, they kind of clash and I can't really settle on a
  style."* **There is no sun-off**: the SUN key cycles 12 / 30 / 57 and all three are a hard
  directional. What he is describing liking is the SHAPING going away, and that is three
  intensities and a shadow flag -- no shader, no render target, nothing to get wrong.
  **THE AMBIENT TAKES BACK WHAT THE DIRECTIONAL GIVES UP**, or "flat" reads as "darker" and the
  two cannot be judged apart. A hemisphere lights every surface whatever it faces, so it buys
  back more per unit than the sun gives up: sun x.30, fill x.55, hemi x1.70, no shadow.
  **AND THE PRESS HITCHES**, because `castShadow` moves a shader define and three recompiles
  every material that receives one -- the IBL key's own sentence.
  **WHAT THIS IS NOT IS THE PAINTED LOOK, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN DRESSED UP.** A painted
  world is Shredworld's two passes: a TOON RAMP on the diffuse (c-whatever's fourteen builds of
  white balls, because **the ramp must never feed the SPECULAR** -- three's `V_GGX` collapses
  onto EPSILON on a silhouette and returns ~500000, and the ramp's `floor` keeps the irradiance
  at a third of full sun where the true `dotNL` is zero) and `paintPatch` (c127), whose trick is
  **the THRESHOLD and not the noise**: areas of one flat colour with a DARKENED SEAM where two
  meet, domain-warped because value noise on an integer lattice draws graph paper. Both are
  procedural and cost zero asset bytes, which is why they are the right answer for a phone.
  **THE BLOCKER HERE IS THAT AN INSTANCE `onBeforeCompile` SHADOWS THE PROTOTYPE'S COMPLETELY**,
  and melee has two (`hueGlow` and the City_Trim tint) -- so a prototype patch would paint the
  roads, the ground and the props and leave the BUILDINGS and the WEAPONS out, which is a
  partial application that looks like a bug. The port has to chain through both hooks. It is
  its own build and it is the next one. **(m141 IS THAT BUILD -- see above.)**
- **THE SUN HAD TWO WRITERS AND THE OLDER ONE WON EVERY FRAME FOR FOURTEEN BUILDS (m138,
  `stepSun`).** Twenty-two lines below the call to `stepSun`, at the bottom of `frame()` and two
  statements above `renderer.render`, sat the ORIGINAL follow:
      sun.position.set(player.pos.x + 7, player.pos.y + 14, player.pos.z + 6);
  unconditional, in both worlds, every frame. `atan2(14, hypot(7, 6))` is **56.6 degrees** -- so
  m124 added `stepSun` for Weirdport and left the line it replaced, and from that build on the
  light has been pinned where it was.
  **WHAT IT COST IS m133 ENTIRELY.** That build dropped the sun 56.9 -> 12 degrees to put the
  disc inside the **16.4 degrees** of sky this camera can see, and it moved `_sunOff`, which is
  what `skyBake` and `stepShafts` read -- so the DISC came down, the SHAFTS came down and **the
  light and every shadow in the game stayed at 56.6**. Its own stated consequence, *"a low sun
  is long shadows, 5.9 m against 0.81"*, never once happened; m137's sky was then recoloured and
  judged against shading that disagreed with it by forty-five degrees.
  **AND `mel.sun(deg)` HAS BEEN HALF-CONNECTED SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN** -- it moved the picture of
  the sun and not the light, so every A/B offered on it answered half the question.
  **FOURTH TIME FOR THIS SHAPE**, after `cam.az`, `KIT.on` and `p.rHold`: two writers on one
  value and whichever runs last wins. This one hid for fourteen builds because the thing it
  broke is invisible unless you already know where the sun is supposed to be -- which is an
  argument for m129's "all three read `_sunOff`" being worth MORE than it looked, not less: it
  was right, and the fourth writer was simply not counted.
- **AND THE SHADOW CAMERA SNAPS TO WHOLE MAP TEXELS NOW (m138, `SHADOW.snap`).** *"There's some
  weird artifact happening on this brick texture, like when you move it glitches."* A 44 m box
  across a 2048 map is **21.5 mm per texel**, and the camera was placed at his exact continuous
  position every frame -- so every surface re-sampled at a different sub-texel offset on every
  frame and the quantisation boundary of every shadow edge CRAWLED. Still when you stand,
  swimming when you walk.
  **THE SNAP IS IN THE LIGHT'S OWN FRAME, NEVER IN WORLD SPACE.** The map's texel grid lies
  along the shadow camera's axes, so rounding world x and z pins it to a grid the map has not
  got unless the sun happens to lie down an axis. Only the two LATERAL components are snapped;
  the along-light one stays exact, because that is depth and `near`/`far` still have to bracket
  him. **And the reference vector must not be parallel to the light** -- at `mel.sun(89)`
  `cross(dir, up)` is zero-length and a normalised zero is NaN in every position the shadow
  camera is handed from then on, which is not a wrong shadow but no shadow at all.
  **THIS IS NOT THE BRICK AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN DRESSED UP.** `WP.cast` is 0 -- the
  city receives shadows and does not cast them -- so the only casters near that wall are the
  player and the bodies, and the stepped blocks in his shot are metres across. The snap is a
  real fault in the shadows that DO exist and it is not the artifact he circled. Nothing in this
  container has a GPU, so the remaining candidates (z-fighting between two coplanar faces in his
  export; the trim sheet's filtering at a grazing angle) cannot be told apart from here -- which
  is what the SUN key is for.
- **A BANK IS ONLY AS EVEN AS ITS LOUDEST FILE, AND NOTHING IN `snd` EVENED IT (m138,
  `SFX.even`, `sfxEven`).** *"There's like a tap too... I don't know why one of them sounds like
  this weird tap. The second footsteps is soft and sounds right, but there's just annoying tap
  thing."* Measured with `npm run sfx` over his own four, peak of the window the game plays:
      footstep_2_l **0.829**   footstep_l 0.601   footstep_2_r 0.589   footstep_r **0.368**
  a **7 dB** spread inside one bank -- and `STEP.g0/g1` is ONE gain for all four, so the loud
  one arrives 2.25x the quiet one every time it is drawn, which is every other left foot.
  **AND `footstep_2_l` IS ALSO THE SHORTEST BY HALF.** `sfxEdge` opens it at **0.144 s** of a
  0.312 s file -- 144 ms of lead-in sits under a quarter of its own (hot) peak -- so the game
  plays 168 ms of it where the other three play 230 to 262. Loudest and shortest is a TAP by
  construction, and that half is in the recording rather than in the code.
  **THE PEAK OF A RECORDING IS NOT A DECISION ANYBODY MADE ABOUT THE GAME.** It is where the
  file happened to land when it was cut. Files in one bank are ALTERNATIVES FOR ONE EVENT: they
  are meant to differ in character, and how loud the event is belongs to the caller -- the speed
  ramp, the mood table, the charge, the power -- which is how every one of these systems is
  already designed. So each file is scaled to its bank's own MEDIAN peak, capped on the way up
  (`evenMax`) because a nearly-silent file would otherwise be handed a huge multiplier and
  amplify its own noise floor.
  **IT IS SELF-DISARMING, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO APPLY EVERYWHERE** rather than to a
  list somebody has to keep in step. Measured over all nine banks:
      drop   x1.00..x1.00   swoosh x0.96..x1.05   clang    x0.98..x1.23
      pbody  x0.99..x1.01   hit    x1.00..x1.24   grunt    x0.99..x1.43
      plasma x0.75..x1.48   foot   x0.72..x1.60   creature x0.65..x1.60
  **The one it genuinely changes is `plasma`**: m58 ranks that bank lightest-first and
  `plasmaPick` takes a window in it by charge, so plasma_06 coming up 1.48x narrows the score
  spread from x2.76 to about x1.9. That is the right trade by m58's own sentence (*"the FILE
  gives the character and the GAIN gives the charge"*) -- the length, the body and the spectrum
  still differ, and what it stops giving is a few free decibels from how a file was cut.
  `creature_noise_04` is the worst spread in the game at x2.84 and nobody had noticed, because a
  creature noise has no rhythm to be out of. `mel.SFX.even = 0` is the one word back.
- **THE SUN IS A KEY NOW, AND IT IS THE ONLY INSTRUMENT THERE IS FOR A LOOK QUESTION (m138,
  `SUNC`, `sunCycle`).** m133 chose 12 degrees and `mel.sun(57)` has been the stated A/B ever
  since -- **on a phone, which has no console**, which is m135's own finding walked straight past
  for three builds running. 12 / 30 / 57 on the FX row, and **the LABEL is the state**: a
  lit/unlit segment would have to decide which elevation counts as "on", which is a decision
  nobody made.
  **`sunSet` AND `sunElev` ARE LIFTED OUT OF `mel.sun` SO THERE IS ONE COPY.** The key and the
  console handle ask the identical question, and a second copy of that arithmetic is a second
  place for the disc, the shafts and the shading to drift apart -- which is the bug three notes
  up, in miniature.
- **THE FLOATIES, AND THE BOX WAS WHY HE COULD NOT FIND THEM (m138, `DUST.back`).** *"I don't
  wanna do like a render pass because it would be expensive, but I do think putting in some of
  the floaties, those like dragonfly looking points, would be nice."* Right on the first half:
  real volumetric rays and a bloom both need this game's FIRST render target, which m130
  declined for a phone already at 27 fps. **Specks need none of it** -- one `Points`, one draw
  call -- which is why they are the one thing on that list that ports for nothing.
  **THE DENSITY IS MATCHED TO HIS OWN STUDY RATHER THAN GUESSED.** Kasumigawa's petal field is
  1800 motes in a 90 x 30 x 120 m box = **0.0056 per cubic metre**; 520 in a 44 m cube is 0.0061.
  m130's 220 in a 26 m cube was **denser** at 0.0125 and invisible anyway, because the box was
  13 m across and the edge fade starts at .72 of that: **every mote in the game lived within
  9.4 m of the lens.** A field you have to stand inside is not an atmosphere.
  **AND A MOTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE SUN CATCHES IT.** That back-lit term is what separates a
  speck from noise over there -- its petals carry `pow(max(dot(V, sun), 0), 4)`.
  **IT IS ALPHA AND NOT BRIGHTNESS, WHICH IS m137's CORRECTION HOLDING**: against a bright sky a
  whitened or additive mote has no headroom and washes out, so catching the light means being
  more THERE rather than being paler. **And it is per mote on the CPU, not in the shader**,
  because `puffPool` is shared with the smoke and a back-lit term on a cigarette plume is wrong.
  520 dot products a frame against a second material and a second draw call.
  **It reads `_sunOff`**, so a mote cannot catch a sun the sky has not got -- and since the note
  three up, that vector is finally the one the shading uses too.
- **A SECOND PAIR OF FOOTSTEPS IS VARIETY, NOT A SECOND FOOT (m137).** He pushed
  `footstep_2_l.mp3` / `footstep_2_r.mp3` beside m136's pair, and the index m136 wrote was the
  FOOT itself (`left ? 0 : 1`) -- so four files would have played as two and **his two new
  recordings would have been hashed, downloaded and never once heard.** The list is whole
  [left, right] PAIRS now and `footSnd` rolls which pair per footfall, so a left foot is always
  a left recording and two consecutive left feet are not the same file. A third pair is two more
  entries and no code change.
  **AND THE PAIR IS ROLLED OVER WHAT HAS DECODED.** `SFX.buf[k][i] = b` leaves a SPARSE array
  while the bank is still arriving, and `snd` returns on `!list[i]` -- so a pair picked before
  its file lands is a silent footfall. A **reservoir pick** is one pass and allocates nothing,
  which matters six times a second, and with nothing decoded for that foot the index stays
  `undefined` and `snd`'s own random roll takes over: m136's fallback generalised rather than a
  second rule.
  **THE ORDERING IS THE ONLY THING SAYING WHICH FILE IS WHICH FOOT**, exactly as
  `SFX.files.plasma` is lightest-first. Keep it in pairs and keep each pair [left, right].

- **THE WORLD IS WHITE AND EVERY ATMOSPHERIC EFFECT IN IT WAS ALSO WHITE (m137).** *"I don't see
  what shaft does and I don't see what dust does. I still just see a white background -- do you
  need me to add an HDRI? You can't see the sun at all because there's just a white haze in the
  far distant background. It doesn't look like fog at all, it just looks like a grayish white
  background. There used to be fog you could actually see and that's how we'd see the sunrise."*
  **FOUR SYMPTOMS, ONE CAUSE, AND NO, HE DOES NOT NEED TO ADD AN HDRI.** m129's argument stands
  whole: a generated gradient serves the backdrop AND the IBL at **zero asset bytes**, its
  exposure is known by construction because it is built from linear numbers, and there is no
  `t.colorSpace` to get backwards. A 2K panorama would be ~22 MB resident and would re-open every
  one of those. **The sky he already has was deliberately coloured to be indistinguishable from
  the flat background it replaced**, and its halo is wider than the whole 16.4 degrees of sky this
  camera can see. Measured through the shipped `NeutralToneMapping` at exposure 1:
      hor 0xe7edf5  ->  rgb(223, 229, 237)     `SKY.fog` hands the FOG that same colour
      top of band   ->  rgb(180, 203, 231)     near-white to near-white across the whole sky
      sun disc      ->  rgb(254, 249, 241)     about **20 points** of contrast. On white.
      the HALO      **.38 rad = 21.8 deg against a 16.4 deg band -- 1.33x the visible sky.**
                    At the horizon under the sun it is +0.872 linear on a sky already near 0.8,
                    so looking anywhere near the sun the WHOLE band blew out, and 90 degrees
                    away it is exactly 0. m133 moved the sun into the band and nobody re-checked
                    the halo's width against the band it had just been moved into.
      the SHAFTS    additive `col` 0xffe9c0 x .35 x opacity .192 = about rgb(75, 68, 55) added
                    onto rgb(223, 229, 237). **They ARE drawing; they saturate.**
      the DUST      0xfff4de at alpha .16, NormalBlending, on a near-white sky and a white
                    floor -- invisible by construction -- and `size` .020 m at 13 m is **1.2
                    CSS px**, under the threshold of being an effect (m99's own rule).
  **SO ONE CHANGE ANSWERS ALL FOUR: GIVE THE SKY REAL COLOUR AND THE ATMOSPHERE ROOM TO READ
  AGAINST IT.** After, through the same tone map:
      hor 0xd9bf9d  ->  rgb(211, 184, 148)   a warm sand haze, and **this IS the fog**
      zen 0x3b8fd9, bend .45  ->  top of band rgb(146, 158, 187)
      sunGlow .12 (6.9 deg, inside the band with room)  ->  disc rgb(254, 247, 238) against
                    rgb(146..211) -- **about 90 points of contrast against about 20**
      DUST  col 0xa89572, alpha [.25, .70], size [.028, .075]
  **THE FOG COMES BACK FOR FREE AND THAT IS THE POINT.** `SKY.fog` has handed the fog the horizon
  colour since m129 (*"a blue sky behind pale fog is two horizons"*), so warming the horizon warms
  the haze with it -- one number, and the thing he misses arrives as a consequence rather than as
  a second edit. **The fog RANGE is untouched** (m125's 70..320, which a 280 m city needs); only
  its colour moved, which is one variable.
  **AND THE SHAFT NUMBERS ARE UNTOUCHED, DELIBERATELY.** Killing the halo and colouring the sky
  restores their headroom by themselves, so this build moves the sky and finds out what the shafts
  look like against it -- rather than moving two things neither of which could then be judged.
  **THE STATED COST: `scene.environment` IS BAKED FROM THIS SAME TEXTURE.** At `envInt` .35 a
  warmer horizon warms the whole city's bounce, and he said the IBL is nice -- so that is a real
  consequence of this line and not a side effect to be hidden. `mel.ibl(0)` is the A/B and
  `mel.sky({ hor: 0xe7edf5, zen: 0x6ea8de, bend: .60, sunGlow: .38 })` is m136 exactly.
  **AND m130's OWN NOTE HAD THE DUST POLARITY INVERTED**, corrected here rather than quietly
  edited: it says *"alpha motes read on a dark road and additive ones read against a bright sky"*.
  **Backwards.** Additive against a bright sky has almost no headroom left before it clips; what
  reads against a bright backdrop is something DARKER, which is why the mote is a warm mid-tone
  and stays on `NormalBlending`.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** there is no GPU here, so whether a sand horizon reads as a
  sunrise or as dust, whether the shafts are now visible, and whether the warmed IBL is an
  improvement are all device questions -- which is the whole reason m135's four keys exist.
  Both gates pass, and `skyBake` still self-checks at **sun dot 1.000**.

- **I HANDED HIM FOUR CONSOLE COMMANDS AND HE PLAYS ON A PHONE (m135, `#fxKey`, `fxSet`).**
  *"I have no idea what this means or how to try it."* `mel.tint(1)`, `mel.shafts(0)`,
  `mel.ibl(0)`, `mel.dust(0)` -- four A/Bs shipped across m126..m133 and every one of them is a
  CONSOLE HANDLE. **There is no console on a phone**, which is m128's own sentence about
  `mel.boxes()`, written after Shredworld was asked three times for a collider view; I wrote it
  down, built a key for that one, and then spent four builds handing him things he cannot type.
  **A control he cannot find is a control that does not exist**, and an A/B he cannot reach is
  a build wasted, because the question every one of them asks is a DEVICE question -- nothing
  in this container has a GPU or a touchscreen, so his phone is the only instrument there is.
  **AND A FRAME-RATE HUNT IS THE CASE THAT MOST NEEDS THEM.** 37 fps at m128 and 24 now, across
  a span that added an IBL (m129), the dust and the shafts (m130) and moved the sun (m133) --
  so the answer is one of four things and the only way to learn which is to move ONE VARIABLE
  at a time on the device. That is why it is four switches and not one "effects" toggle.
      SHAFTS   nine additive quads near the lens -- fill by definition
      IBL      an env lookup per fragment on every PBR surface in the city
      DUST     220 points, one draw call. Almost certainly not it; the control that rules a
               suspect OUT is worth as much as the one that catches it
      TINT     the m126 colour space, lit = sRGB. Weirdport only
  **AND THE SHAFTS' COST MOVED AT m133 WITH NOTHING SAYING SO.** Alpha is free -- the fragment
  blends either way -- so those quads always paid their fill whenever they drew, and what m133
  changed is HOW OFTEN. `stepShafts` bails under `a < .004`, which is a cone about the sun's
  bearing, and lowering the sun widened it:
      sun 56.9   drew within +/-31 deg of the sun's bearing   17% of a turn, at opacity .009
      sun 12.0   draws within +/-71 deg                       39% of a turn, at opacity .192
  **More than twice as often, and now actually filling.** That is a real cost this side put in
  at m133 and did not cost, and it is the first thing the SHAFTS key is there to settle.
  **NOTHING IN THE KEYS RESTATES A RULE.** Each moves the same field its console handle moves
  and calls the same rebuild -- `dustDrop` and `shaftDrop` came OUT of `mel.dust`/`mel.shafts`
  for exactly that reason, because two callers and two copies of "how do you take this pool
  down" is `setBoxes`' own ONE-PLACE rule one pool over.
  **AND THEY ARE REPAINTED WHEN THE STATE MOVES, NOT WHEN ONE IS PRESSED** -- one packed
  compare a frame, so a key can never read `off` over an effect that is plainly running, which
  is the disagreement m128 built `bvLit` to prevent.
  **THE TINT SEGMENT HIDES OUTSIDE WEIRDPORT** (`paintKit`'s rule): the vertex tint is that
  world's, so on the test site it would be a switch that does nothing, which is worse than no
  switch. **And `pointer-events` is on the SEGMENTS, not on the row** -- a thumb landing in a
  gap must do nothing rather than the nearer thing.
  **THE IBL PRESS HITCHES AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** `skyBake` re-prefilters and
  three recompiles every material, so the frame it is pressed on is expensive -- which, at the
  one moment he is counting frames, reads as the thing he just switched OFF costing more.
  **VERIFIED THE m130 WAY**: a throw put inside `fxKeys` makes `check:boot` fail out of
  `frame()`, so the gate genuinely reaches it -- then removed and the file diffed. A gate that
  is green because the code never ran is the thing that discipline exists to catch.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED:** which switch moves the number. That is the whole point of shipping
  them rather than guessing, and it is his to read off the chip.

- **THE SUN WAS 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE TOP OF THE FRAME, AND THAT IS WHY NOTHING LOOKED DIFFERENT
  (m133).** *"I'm on 129 and I don't really see any changes. Did you put in the sun or the
  background? I'm wondering if the fog is just covering up the background."* **It is not the fog
  -- `scene.fog` applies to MESHES and `scene.background` is never fogged**, so that hypothesis
  can be ruled out outright. The sky was in, the IBL was in, and all three of the things built on
  them were invisible by construction. `CAM.fov` is 58 and **`CAM.el` is a CONSTANT .22 rad of
  DOWNWARD pitch**, so the only sky on screen is the band from the horizon to `fov/2 - el` =
  **16.4 degrees**, at every bearing, for ever -- and (6, 12, 5) put the sun at
  asin(12/14.32) = **56.9**:
      the DISC      **40 degrees above the top of the screen**. `SKY.sun`, `sunSize`, `sunGlow`
                    and `sunK` have never once been on screen, at any camera bearing
      the SHAFTS    `stepShafts` keys on `camFwd . sunDir`, whose best case is
                    cos(56.9 + 12.6) = **.350**, so `gain * pow(k, 3.2)` = .26 x .035 =
                    **opacity 0.009**. It clears the `a < .004` cutoff and draws at under ONE
                    PER CENT -- **m130 has never been visible either**
      the GRADIENT  `bend` 1.35 is a power on sin(elevation), so at the top of the band it
                    returned t = **0.181**: the sky ran #e7edf5 to **#d7e2f1**, a 6% shift, and
                    `SKY.hor` is by m129's own deliberate choice the exact colour the game
                    already had. So the gradient was genuinely there and genuinely
                    indistinguishable from the flat background it replaced
  **ONE FACT -- WHERE THE SUN IS -- AND m129'S "ALL THREE READ `_sunOff`" IS WHAT MAKES IT ONE
  EDIT.** That note was written so the disc, the shading and the rays could not drift apart; this
  is the first time it has been collected on, and it is the difference between one line and three
  numbers to keep in step. Same BEARING and same length (14.32), elevation 56.9 -> **12.0**:
      the disc (3.2 deg of angular radius) lands at 8.8..15.2, squarely inside the band
      the shafts go to **.192 -- 21x** what they have ever drawn at
      `bend` .60 puts t = 0.468 at the top of the band: #e7edf5 -> **#b5cfeb**
  **THE SHADING MOVES WITH IT AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A SIDE EFFECT.** A sun you can
  SEE is a low sun, and a low sun is long shadows: a 1.25 m body casts 0.81 m at 57 degrees and
  **5.9 m** at 12, well inside the 44 m shadow box either way. `sun.shadow.normalBias` 0.04 goes
  with it as insurance against grazing-angle acne -- **that one cannot be measured here** (no
  GPU) and is shipped as a predictable consequence of the line above rather than as a fix for
  something seen. `mel.sun(57)` is the whole A/B back, `mel.sun()` says where it is.
  **AND THE LESSON IS THE CAMERA, NOT THE SKY.** Anything meant to be SEEN in this game has to be
  placed in the FRAME'S terms -- 0 to 16.4 degrees of elevation -- and never in world terms that
  look reasonable in a viewer. That is Shredworld's *"a cloud is placed in ANGLE, never in
  metres"* arriving here, and it cost two builds of effects nobody could see.

- **AND HIS "WEIRD COLLIDE ON PARK BENCHES" IS THE BOX HE AUTHORED, NOT THE QUERY (m133).**
  *"Would it be really computationally expensive to just do raycasting for collisions, because
  I'm going up against everything like park benches and they all just have weird collide."*
  **RAYCASTING WOULD CHANGE NOTHING, BECAUSE THESE ALREADY ARE BOXES.** Measured off the real
  collision file (plain glTF, m131) -- every street prop is **12 triangles**, `boxSkew` **1.00**,
  so each one is an honestly axis-aligned box and a ray against its own triangles returns exactly
  the surface `resolveBoxes` already tests. What is wrong is the SIZE:
      prop_bench_parkblock_col   1.37 x 1.62 x **1.47 m**   a bench is ~1.7 x 0.6 x 0.85
                                 -> 2.7x the plan area, and 1.47 m is CHEST HEIGHT on a 1.25 m
                                    body, so it is cover rather than something you step over
      prop_lamp_*_col            0.40 x 0.40 x **5.20 m**   a lamp post is ~0.15 across -> 7x
      prop_bollard_inst_col      0.40 x 0.40 x 0.95         a bollard is ~0.20 across -> 4x
      prop_parkingmeter_inst_col 0.40 x 0.40 x 1.45         a meter post is ~0.10 across
      prop_hydrant_inst_col      0.40 x 0.40 x 0.90
      prop_tree_*_col            0.70 x 0.70 x 3.00         his own stated convention, and fine
  **So a 1.5 m cube round every bench is the collider working exactly as exported.** The fix is
  a smaller box in his Blender file, one number per prop, and it needs no code change here at all.
  **AND THE 5.2 m LAMP IS ALSO THE m128 LEDGE CANDIDATE** -- over `LEDGE.tall`, its top edge is in
  `BOXES`, and its box is 40 cm where the post is 15 -- which ties *"weird collider geometry I'm
  floating on"* to the same table.
  **WHAT RAYCASTING WOULD COST, SINCE HE ASKED:** the existing test is an AABB overlap behind
  `BGRID`/`boxesNear`, which m124 measured at a mean of **9.8 boxes per query** out of 4,086.
  Sweeping a capsule against triangles means a BVH over Weirdport's 13,762 collision triangles
  plus a segment-triangle test per candidate -- strictly more work per frame, on a phone already
  at 37 fps, to get the same answer about a shape that is a box either way. **It is the right
  tool for a world whose collider is a real mesh and the wrong one for a world whose collider is
  boxes somebody authored.**
  **THE ONE REAL COLLIDER FAULT ON THIS SIDE IS STILL THE 55 VEHICLES** (m129/m131): axis-aligned
  boxes of ROTATED cars, mean plan inflation x1.28 and worst x2.13. `boxSkew` correctly passes
  them because they genuinely are axis-aligned now; recovering the yaw means pairing each to its
  visual instance by position and carrying `b.yaw` into `resolveBoxes`. That is the next build.

- **THE 12-TRIANGLE SHORTCUT WAS THE WHOLE VEHICLE-COLLIDER FAULT, AND MY FIRST DIAGNOSIS OF THE
  OTHER HALF WAS WRONG (m131, `boxSkew`, `WP.cols.skew`).** *"The colliders for the cars in
  general are pretty big. The van's one is like skewed cockeye offset."*
  **IT IS NOT SKEW, IT IS THE AXIS-ALIGNED BOX OF A ROTATED CAR.** Measured off the real
  collision file: 55 vehicles, mean plan-area inflation **x1.28**, worst **x2.13**. A car parked
  square gets 2.25 x 4.00; the same model at an angle gets a near-SQUARE 4.79 x 5.92, which is
  why it reads as cockeyed rather than merely big -- the box is not turned with the car, it is
  the smallest upright box containing it. **Proved by pairing**: `inst_car_1_i_2` is at 64.8 deg
  at (74, 36) in the visual file, a 2.84 x 5.20 car at that yaw has an axis-aligned footprint of
  5.91 x 4.79, and `prop_car_1_i_col2` at that exact position measures 4.79 x 5.92.
  **AND I TOLD HIM THE BUILDINGS WERE A SECOND, SEPARATE FAULT OF MINE. THEY ARE NOT.** I said 62
  of 202 `solid_`/`bld_` meshes have an AABB bigger than their geometry and that `solidColumns`
  was collapsing them to it. The first half is true; the second is not -- run through the SHIPPED
  function over the real file, only 21 meshes collapse at all, the biggest resulting box is a
  legitimate 676 m2 building plan, and **exactly 4 meshes both collapse AND are inflated**, three
  of them by 7-18% on plan areas of 1 to 5 m2. Raising `fill` from .5 to .8 moves 3737 boxes to
  3752 and changes nothing that matters. **The collapse test is fine and the fix I was about to
  ship for it would have done nothing.** The rasteriser follows the true shape; that was the
  point of it.
  **SO THE WHOLE FAULT IS IN ONE PLACE: the 12-triangle shortcut.** m124's claim -- *"a box and
  its AABB is exact"* -- holds for 347 of the 349 twelve-triangle solids and fails for the two
  turned 45 degrees: `prop_plaza_ledge_iron_a/b_col` are 14.51 x 0.06 m rails whose bounds are
  10.30 x 10.30, so each was a **106 m2 invisible slab** across a plaza, **x121.86** its own area.
  Diverted to the rasteriser they come out as ten boxes of 1 m2, and the whole change costs the
  city **eighteen boxes**.
  **AND THE OBVIOUS TEST IS WRONG, WHICH THE VERIFICATION IS WHAT CAUGHT.** My first version asked
  whether every vertex sits on one of the two extremes in X and in Z -- exact for a box, and
  **true of these rails**, because a 6 cm bar running corner to corner has all eight vertices
  bunched at two OPPOSITE corners of its own bounding box. It diverted them offline only by
  accident of a 2 cm tolerance and diverted **nothing** at the 45 cm one it shipped with. I found
  that by re-running the measurement with the SHIPPED function instead of with the copy I had
  tested -- which is this account's oldest rule finally being applied to my own fix rather than
  to somebody else's harness. **A tolerance in metres cannot separate a 6 cm bar from a 10 m box
  anyway.** `boxSkew` sweeps the footprint for the tightest rectangle and returns the area ratio,
  which is scale-free: an axis-aligned box reads exactly **1.000** and needs no tolerance, and the
  rails read 121.86. One degree of sweep resolution costs under 2% of area, well inside `skew`.
  **IT IS STRUCTURAL AND SELF-DISARMING.** Nothing is named: a future export that rotates
  something else is caught by the same line, and one that stops rotating these stops matching, one
  mesh at a time.
  **STILL NOT FIXED: THE 55 VEHICLES.** Their orientation is *already gone* from the collision
  export -- every node is at identity and the boxes are baked axis-aligned -- so `boxSkew`
  correctly passes them, because they ARE axis-aligned now. Recovering them means pairing each one
  to its visual instance by position for the yaw and carrying `b.yaw` into `resolveBoxes`,
  Shredworld's oriented-box answer. That is a real build and it is next. The other way is his
  export emitting the rotated box, after which `boxSkew` picks it up with no code change at all.
- **AND THE COLLISION GLB IS NOT DRACO, WHICH WAS STATED WRONGLY TWICE (m131).**
  `weirdport_slice_collision.glb` is plain glTF -- only the VISUAL file is compressed. m124 and
  m127 both say otherwise and both are wrong. Every collider vertex is readable here in a second
  with `fs.readFileSync` and a 20-line GLB chunk walk, which is how all of the above was measured,
  and `npm run bld`'s own note that it must use synthetic shells is now only true of the building
  and the tower. **Anything about the Weirdport collider is measurable offline against the real
  asset and should be measured rather than reasoned about.**
  **AND THE FIRST PROBE MEASURED THE WRONG SET**, which nearly produced a second wrong finding: it
  filtered `/^(solid|bld|ground|ramp)_/` where the game's `WP.solid` is `/^(bld|solid|prop)_/`, so
  it fed the ROAD SURFACE to the rasteriser and duly reported a 62,675 m2 box the game does not
  have. Use the game's own regexes.
- **THE AIR: DUST THAT GLIMMERS AND SHAFTS OFF THE SUN (m130, `DUST`, `SHAFT`).** *"The sun makes
  these like nice rays... and there's like these little dust kind of particle things that kind of
  glimmer and float around."* Two switches, because they are two different costs and neither can
  be judged while the other is moving.
  **THE DUST HAS ITS OWN POOL, NOT `SPK`.** That one is 560 and m118 measured the morph taking
  about 190 of them at once; a field that lives FOR EVER would sit in it permanently and starve
  every impact in the game. One more `Points` is one more draw call and no shared state -- and it
  reuses `puffPool`/`puffFlush`, so `gl_PointSize = aSize * uPx / -mv.z` with `uPx` derived from
  the framebuffer comes with it and a mote is N world METRES at any lens.
  **AND IT IS A LOCAL FIELD THAT WRAPS.** City's cloud rule: a box kept round the lens, and a mote
  that leaves it comes back in the far side. So 220 points cover a 280 m city exactly as well as a
  white room, nothing is spawned as he walks, and the count is a constant rather than a density.
  **ROUND THE CAMERA, NOT ROUND HIM** -- on a boom several metres behind him those are different
  boxes, and what you see is what is near the LENS.
  **AND FADED AT THE EDGE**, or the wrap is a mote blinking out of one corner and into another.
  **THE GLIMMER IS ITS OWN RATE AND ITS OWN PHASE PER MOTE.** One shared clock is 220 motes
  pulsing together, which is a strobe and not dust -- the smoke plumes' rule (m41), one effect
  over.
  **THE SHAFTS ARE BILLBOARD CARDS, NOT A POST PASS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DECISION.** Real
  volumetric rays are an occlusion buffer plus a radial blur, which means rendering the scene to a
  texture -- and **there is no post chain in this game at all**: one `renderer.render(scene,
  camera)`, no `EffectComposer`, no render targets. Adding one for this puts a full-screen blur on
  a phone already at 37 fps, which is the fill cost m128 named as the likely reason it is at 37.
  **They are still overdraw and that is stated rather than hidden**: long additive quads near the
  lens are fill by definition, and `SHAFT.n` (9) is the dial.
  **THEY ONLY DRAW WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING TOWARD THE SUN.** `pow(max(0, camFwd . sunDir), 3.2)` --
  which is what makes it read as sun rays rather than as slabs of fog standing in the street, and
  is also most of what makes it cheap: pointed away it returns before drawing anything.
  **THE CARDS ROLL ABOUT THE SUN AXIS, NOT ABOUT THE CAMERA.** A shaft is a cylinder of light, so
  the card standing in for it keeps its long axis ON the sun and turns about THAT; a full
  billboard would swing it off the sun and stop it being a shaft. The basis is built directly
  (`Y` = sun, `Z` = the part of camera-minus-player across it, `X` = `Y x Z`) rather than as two
  chained rotations.
  **AND THE DEGENERATE CASE IS EXACTLY WHEN IT IS BRIGHTEST.** Looking straight down the sun makes
  `Z` zero-length, and normalising that is a NaN quaternion and a black hole where the effect was.
  It falls back to any perpendicular.
  **THE FALLOFF IS IN THE VERTEX COLOUR AND THE BLENDING IS ADDITIVE**, so a card's intensity IS
  its colour and no custom shader is needed -- three's `vertexColors` on a `MeshBasicMaterial`
  does it. Both ends go to black, which under additive is invisible, so a shaft fades out rather
  than stopping at an edge. **And the light is down the MIDDLE**, which a single quad cannot say:
  six vertices can only put brightness at corners, so each card is split lengthways into two
  halves sharing a bright seam.
  **THE SUN IS `_sunOff` IN ALL THREE PLACES** -- the directional light, m129's sky disc, and
  these -- so they agree by construction rather than by three numbers being kept in step.
  **AND THE GATE GENUINELY REACHES BOTH, WHICH WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.**
  `requestAnimationFrame` is stubbed to a no-op and `frame()` is called once at module scope, so
  the first frame really does run -- verified the c167 way, by putting a throw in `stepDust` and
  watching `check:boot` exit 1 with it, and a log in `stepShafts` and watching it print. Both were
  then removed and the file diffed to confirm no residue. **A gate that is green because the code
  never ran is the thing that discipline exists to catch.**
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED:** there is no GPU here, so whether the motes read as glimmer rather than
  as noise, whether 9 cards is rays or haze, and what either costs in frames are device questions.
  `mel.dust(0)` and `mel.shafts(0)` are the switches; `mel.dust({add:1})` is the additive A/B,
  which matters because alpha motes read on a dark road and additive ones read against a bright
  sky, and this world has both. **-- THAT POLARITY IS BACKWARDS AND m137 CORRECTS IT:** additive
  against a bright sky has almost no headroom before it clips, and what reads against a bright
  backdrop is something DARKER. Left in place rather than edited, because the claim is what cost
  a build.
- **THERE WAS NO SKY AND NO IMAGE-BASED LIGHTING AT ALL, AND THE FIX IS GENERATED RATHER THAN A
  FILE (m129, `SKY`, `skyBake`).** *"Right now we don't actually have like any background sky or
  HDRI that I know of."* Right, and worse: `scene.background` was a flat `0xe7edf5` and
  **`scene.environment` was never set anywhere in the file**, so every surface in the city was
  lit by three lights and had nothing whatever to reflect.
  **ONE GRADIENT SERVES BOTH JOBS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.** It is baked into a small equirect
  and that one texture is the visible backdrop AND, through `PMREMGenerator`, the IBL -- so the
  sky and the light coming off it cannot disagree about what colour the sky is. **Zero asset
  bytes**, nothing on the wire, about a megabyte resident against the ~22 MB a 2K panorama wants.
  **AND IT DELETES A WHOLE CLASS OF BUG THIS ACCOUNT HAS PAID FOR REPEATEDLY.** Shredworld has
  `npm run sky` because *"two skies four stops apart both look fine in a viewer and only one looks
  like a sky in here"* -- the exposure belongs to the IMAGE, must be measured, and must be
  re-measured every time he repaints under the same filename. Here the image is made out of
  numbers already in linear working space, so its exposure is known by construction and there is
  nothing to measure. Same for the colour space: the data is HALF FLOAT and therefore linear, so
  there is no `t.colorSpace` to set before the prefilter and no way to get it backwards -- which
  is a landmine that repo has a paragraph about.
  **HALF FLOAT RATHER THAN BYTES, BECAUSE A 256-STEP GRADIENT BANDS** across a phone screen; and
  rather than FULL float, because linear filtering of a float texture needs
  `OES_texture_float_linear`, which is not universal on mobile, while half-float filtering is core
  in WebGL2. `THREE.DataUtils.toHalfFloat` is three's own converter and is exported from the
  vendored build (checked, along with `PMREMGenerator` and `scene.environmentIntensity`, before a
  line was written).
  **THE ROW MAPPING IS THREE'S OWN `equirectUv`, INVERTED, NOT GUESSED.** That function is
  `v = 0.5 + asin(dir.y) / PI`, and a `DataTexture` is `flipY = false` -- so row 0 is v = 0 is the
  NADIR and the last row is the zenith. Get it backwards and the ground colour is in the sky,
  which looks deliberate and is not.
  **SO THE BAKE CHECKS ITSELF, AND THE CHECK IS THE SUN AND NOT THE GRADIENT.** The brightest
  texel is the disc, so its direction dotted against the light's own has to be **1.000** and a
  flipped `v` would put it near the negative of that. It reads 1.000. **The two row luminances are
  printed and are deliberately NOT an assertion**: the default ground is a pale warm grey and the
  zenith a mid blue, so nadir legitimately reads BRIGHTER (0.426 against 0.366) -- a check written
  on that ordering would fire on a sky that is perfectly correct, which is the wrong-claim-in-a-
  comment mistake this file keeps paying for. I wrote that check, watched it be wrong, and
  replaced it rather than shipping it.
  **THE SUN IS THE SAME VECTOR THE LIGHT USES.** `_sunOff` is the directional light's own offset,
  so the disc in the sky, the shading and (when the shafts land) the rays all come off ONE
  direction rather than three numbers that drift apart -- and `sun dot` is what proves it.
  **THE DEFAULT HORIZON IS THE COLOUR THE GAME ALREADY HAD**, on purpose: switching the sky on
  should ADD a gradient and some bounce, not wrench the palette out from under the city he is
  about to paint. The zenith, the ground and the disc are the new part.
  **AND THE GROUND IS NEVER BLACK.** Below the horizon is a warm neutral, because in an IBL
  everything facing down reflects it -- and a black lower hemisphere is every underside in the
  city going dead.
  **ONE COLOUR IN THE DISTANCE (`SKY.fog`).** Weirdport keeps its own fog RANGE (m125's 70..320,
  which a 280 m city needs) and gives up its fog COLOUR to the horizon, because a blue sky behind
  pale fog is two horizons and the eye reads the seam long before it reads either.
  **THE OLD PMREM TARGET IS DISPOSED ON EVERY RE-BAKE.** `mel.sky({...})` re-bakes live, and a
  PMREM target is a cubemap with a full mip chain -- leaking one per tweak is how a live dial
  turns into a memory bug that only shows after twenty presses.
  **AND THE IBL IS ON ITS OWN SWITCH BECAUSE IT IS THE PART THAT COSTS FRAMES.** `scene.environment`
  is an env lookup per fragment on every PBR surface in the city, on a game already at 37 fps.
  `mel.ibl(0)` keeps the backdrop and drops the lighting, which is the honest A/B. **It forces a
  shader recompile on every material**, so expect a hitch on the toggle itself -- that is the
  toggle, not the feature.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED:** there is no GPU here, so whether it reads as a sky, whether `envInt`
  .35 is bounce or a wash, and whether the IBL is affordable at all are device questions. What
  IS checked, every boot, is the line above. `SKY.on = 0` is the flat colour exactly as it was.
- **AND THE ORDER MATTERS FOR THE PAINTING.** Colours picked against a flat `#e7edf5` background
  read differently once there is a sky and IBL behind them, so the sky went in BEFORE the city is
  painted rather than after -- otherwise they get chosen twice.
- **A SCREENSHOT CANNOT TELL A COLLIDER BOX FROM A HOLE IN THE ART, SO THE GAME DRAWS THEM NOW
  (m128, `BOXV`, `stepBoxView`, the `COLLIDERS` key).** *"There's like these weird collider
  geometry, visible geometry that I'm just like floating on -- I can't tell if it's the vehicle
  or what's going on there. Do I need to edit that in Blender?"*
  **THE CHIP IN THAT SHOT ALREADY SAID WHAT IT WAS: `LEDGE`, AND `0.0 m/s`.** He was not floating
  ON anything, he was HANGING off it -- m102's ledge grab, which searches `BOXES` for the top edge
  of anything over `LEDGE.tall`. That feature was built against TEN boxes on a white floor plus a
  stack put there on purpose; Weirdport is **4,086 boxes** rasterised out of his collision meshes
  by `solidColumns`, so every column-run top edge in the city is a candidate lip. And it is the
  one world where the picture and the thing you walk into are two separate meshes by his own
  design, so a lip can sit where nothing is drawn.
  **BUT WHICH BOX IS NOT ANSWERABLE FROM A PHOTOGRAPH, BY EITHER OF US** -- and shipping a
  `LEDGE.tall` nudge at a box nobody has seen is guessing dressed as a fix. Shredworld earned this
  lesson after being asked three times (*"I need to see the collider"*) and wrote down the other
  half of it: **a debug view that disagrees with the thing it draws is worse than none**, because
  it is a second thing to be wrong. So every number here is read off the SAME fields the resolver
  reads -- `b.minx..maxy` through `boxesNear`, the collider's own broad phase; `K.r`; `p.r`/`p.hh`
  -- and nothing is restated.
  **NOT DEPTH TESTED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.** The question it exists to answer is *there is
  a collider where there is no picture*, so a view the picture can hide is a view that cannot
  answer it.
  **A BODY IS TWO RINGS AND NOT A BOX**, because `pushBodies` tests `r + d.K.r` in PLAN with **no
  height term at all** -- so what a body actually is to the collider is an infinite vertical
  cylinder, and a wire box round a man would be drawing a rule the game has not got. His own
  cylinder is drawn in its own colour beside them, so the two can be COMPARED rather than one of
  them described.
  **AND WHATEVER HAS HOLD OF HIM IS DRAWN LAST, IN ITS OWN COLOUR.** `ledgeFind` and `wallFind`
  carry the box they picked (`best.b`, one field, read here and nowhere else) -- because
  recovering it afterwards from the grip point would be a SECOND search that could disagree with
  the first, which is the whole failure this view exists not to become.
  **ONLY THE BOXES ROUND HIM (`BOXV.r` 20 m, `max` 700).** A buffer holding all 4,086 is a buffer
  nobody can read anyway, and the question is always about the one he is standing on.
  **ONE `LineSegments`, ALLOCATED ONCE, REBUILT ONLY WHILE IT IS ON** -- a fresh `BufferGeometry`
  every frame is garbage on the one frame something is already happening, and `setDrawRange` over
  a fixed buffer costs nothing. `frustumCulled = false`, because the buffer holds WORLD positions
  and a bounding sphere computed from them would cull the whole view the moment he walked away.
  **THE CONTROL IS A KEY, NOT A CONSOLE HANDLE.** There is no settings panel in this game and no
  console on a phone, so `mel.boxes()` alone is a control he cannot find, which is a control that
  does not exist. It sits under the world key in the top-left DIAGNOSTIC gutter -- out of the play
  area, so it takes no thumb -- and it says which state it is in by being lit, so it is not a mode
  you can be in without knowing it. **And the badge tap was NOT taken**: that one is m104's pad
  toggle, and the stats line beside it is deliberately `pointer-events: none` so it cannot eat a
  thumb.
  **THE KEY IS REPAINTED WHEN THE STATE MOVES, NOT WHEN THE KEY IS PRESSED.** `BOXV` is on the
  `mel` handle, so `mel.BOXV.on = 1` from a laptop is a second owner -- and a key reading `off`
  over a screen full of wire boxes is exactly the disagreement this must not have. One tracked
  value in `stepBoxView`, so it is a DOM write when something changes and nothing per frame.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS `· COLLIDERS`**, because "did the toggle take" must not be something he
  infers from whether boxes appeared -- that is the very question the view is here to settle, and
  a diagnostic you have to diagnose is not one.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED:** there is no GPU in this container, so whether the wires read at all is a
  device question. Both gates pass in both worlds.
- **THE CHIP HAS BEEN CRYING WOLF ABOUT A DELIBERATE GAP SINCE m54 (m128).** `NO CLIP ,` in his
  screenshot -- a comma with nothing either side of it -- is `CLIPS.turnL` and `CLIPS.turnR`, which
  are `''` ON PURPOSE: he has no turn clips and m54 wired the hook for the day he draws them.
  **m88 put exactly this guard on the NPC table check and never on the player's own**, so the two
  have disagreed for forty builds. It is the same one word (`n &&`), and what it buys is not
  tidiness: a real missing clip was hiding behind a false one, and a missing clip leaves a bone at
  zero total weight, which is the T-pose exactly.
- **THE CHIP IS THE ONE HUD ELEMENT THAT GROWS, AND THE KEYS UNDER IT HAD A TYPED `top` (m128).**
  In his m127 screenshot the WEIRDPORT key is sitting **ON TOP of the chip's second line**, over
  the very numbers this file keeps telling him to read -- because `#worldKey`'s `top: 56px` was
  right for a one-line chip and is wrong the moment `missing()` has anything to say. That is
  Shredworld's `hudGutter` finding one gutter over: **a constant somebody has to remember to update
  when a line is added is not a mechanism.** `--gut`/`--gut2` come off the chip's measured height.
  **MEASURED ONLY WHEN THE TEXT CHANGES**, because `offsetHeight` forces a layout and this runs
  inside the frame -- a few reads a second when something actually moved, never one per frame. A
  zero rect (hidden, or mid-orientation-change) leaves the last good value rather than stacking
  every key back on the chip.
- **WEIRDPORT HAS PEOPLE IN IT, AND THE WHOLE BUILD IS THE SWEEP THAT MAKES A COORDINATE HONEST
  (m127, `WP.crowd`, `WPSPOT`, `wpStand`, `wpPool`, `wpSpread`, `wpLoop`, `wpPopulate`).** *"Let's
  populate the world with the other characters. Eventually they will have different jobs,
  different behaviors -- the police and like human character got scared of you unless you look
  like a human -- eventually they'll have different zones. But right now we can just put them in
  kind of really randomly just to get a feel of it."*
  **m124 LEFT THEM OUT FOR ONE STATED REASON AND THIS IS THAT REASON ANSWERED.** *"Every warrior,
  drunk, skater, biker and Clancy is placed at a coordinate chosen against the TEST SITE, and a
  body spawned inside a tower is the m24 lesson."* So none of this is a builder: `buildFoes`,
  `buildHicks` and the rest still loop `K.at` and **never learn which world they are in** --
  `wpPopulate` rewrites every one of those tables after the collider and before a single body is
  fetched, which is the only window where both halves are true (the ground exists, and nothing has
  been placed on it yet). `d.K`'s own dividend, one table further out.
  **NOTHING IN THE SWEEP RESTATES A RULE.** The ground is `triGround` and the clearance is
  `resolveBoxes` -- **the PLAYER'S OWN resolver** -- so a spot this accepts is a spot his body
  agrees it can occupy, and there is no second answer to keep in step. A harness with its own copy
  of a rule measures a game that does not exist, and this is that sentence applied to a placer.
  **AND IT IS `triGround`, NEVER `groundAt`.** That one takes a BOX TOP as ground, which is right
  for a man walking onto a roof and exactly wrong for a spawn: it would stand somebody on a bench,
  on a parapet, on the hull of a parked car. The triangles are the deck and nothing else.
  **ONE CEILING KEEPS THEM OFF THE ROOFS AND IT IS A NUMBER, NOT A LIST.** The I-405 deck is at
  9.2 m and every roof in the slice is higher, so `WPSPOT.top` 8 is "the street, the park, the
  plaza and the lower hill" with **not one coordinate typed** to say so.
  **A SPOT IS LEVEL ACROSS HIS OWN WIDTH, NOT AT A POINT.** Four probes at `WPSPOT.r` .50 -- the
  warrior's .46 and a little -- and **one sweep serves every kind**, because a patch clear for the
  widest body is clear for a .28 m sidekick. `hh` 1.7 means the resolver is asked about his HEAD
  and not only his feet.
  **FARTHEST-POINT, NOT THE FIRST N (m80's rule).** The darts are random, so the first thirty of
  them are a random scatter -- and a random scatter CLUMPS. Taking the one furthest from
  everything already taken spreads them over the whole slice by construction, which is what makes
  three of a kind read as three streets rather than as a queue.
  **AND THEY ARE DEALT ROUND-ROBIN, NEVER SLICED.** The spread returns them furthest-first, so a
  slice hands one kind the far edge of the city and another the middle. One to each in turn means
  every kind is spread over the whole slice -- the half of "randomly" a spread alone does not buy.
  **THE SAME CITY EVERY RELOAD (`WPSPOT.seed`).** A coin per body is a different street each time,
  so a coordinate stops being quotable and *"he is stuck at -40, 88"* stops being a bug report --
  Shredworld's `TRAF.share` rule, one roster over. **And the pool excludes `near` 14 m of the
  spawn**: you are not born inside a crowd.
  **THE SIDEKICK IS THE ONE THING NOT SCATTERED, WHICH IS WHAT HE IS FOR.** `foeWander`'s leash
  would walk him back across the city from wherever he was dropped, so he takes the nearest clear
  spot to the spawn -- a ring search outward from 2.5 m, which is the one question the pool cannot
  answer because `near` deliberately excludes that ground.
  **AND SHE IS THE ONE CHARACTER WITH NO COLLIDER AT ALL.** `stepShe` writes `p.x`/`p.z` straight
  and only snaps `p.y`, so a circuit made of clear POINTS is a woman walking through a wall. Every
  SEGMENT is sampled at `WPSPOT.r` (`wpWalk`) and **the last leg back to the first has to be clear
  too** -- a loop with one bad leg is a loop she walks into a building once per lap for ever. No
  loop and she is simply not loaded, with `WP NO CIRCUIT` in the chip.
  **THE CIRCUIT SEARCH IS SORTED AND BUDGETED, WHICH IS WHAT KEEPS IT OFF THE BOOT PATH.** The
  obvious version asks `wpWalk` about every candidate nearer than the best so far, and `wpWalk` is
  about seventy `wpStand` calls on a long leg -- five triangle lookups and a `resolveBoxes` each.
  Sorted by distance and broken on the first clear one, the typical leg costs ONE of them;
  unsorted and unlucky it is one per candidate, per leg, per restart -- millions of grid lookups
  while the card sits there. `WPSPOT.legs` 900 is the backstop under it, because **a bound you can
  reason about beats a shape you hope is fast**.
  **AND `bodySpawn` ASKED `groundAt(x, z, 0)`, WHICH BURIES A BODY ON A HILL.** That function
  answers *the highest surface at or a step above `y`*, so asking at 0 on Weirdport's 17 m terrain
  returns the 0 floor and puts a man twelve metres under the ground he was placed on. It takes the
  spot's own height as a third column now -- and **absent it is provably the line it always was**,
  so every test-site table is untouched. `foeMove` tracks the slope from wherever he starts, so
  the start is the whole of it. `buildShe` had the identical fault and the identical fix.
  **THE BODIES MOVED OUT OF THE TEST SITE'S BRANCH, WHICH IS THE CHANGE THAT ACTUALLY RUNS ANY OF
  THIS.** They were inside the `else`, so Weirdport was a city with nobody in it however good the
  placer was -- the fourth time across these repos that a feature did nothing because of WHERE it
  was called rather than what it did. `BLD`, `TOWER` and `MOTO` stay test-site-only.
  **AND THE MOTORCYCLE IS A STATED GAP RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.** `MOTO.ring` was swept clear
  against ten boxes on a white floor (m107), and a fixed-radius circuit through a real city has to
  be SEARCHED the way the crowd's spots are -- which is its own build. With no bike `MOTO.up` is 0
  and `buildBikers` correctly leaves its rider on foot, with no case of its own.
  **`PROG.total` WAS 4 AGAINST A TEST SITE THAT LOADS FIFTEEN FILES**, so the bar was home before
  half the city had arrived -- and the old fix set it INSIDE the world branch, which makes the bar
  RETREAT from 100% the moment the branch is reached. A bar that retreats reads as a failure. It
  is the real count, decided at the top of `init()` before anything is fetched.
  **AND `wpPopulate` IS IN A TRY, because a crowd is not worth a boot that hangs.** Every other
  line in that branch is `side()`-wrapped for exactly that reason and `init()` is called bare, so
  a throw there is `rig.ready` never set and a card stuck for ever on the text it was born with --
  the one failure he cannot look at and correct.
  **THE CHIP CARRIES `WPCROWD<n>`**, because *"the street is empty"* is three bugs and one picture
  from a phone: the sweep found nothing, it found spots and the GLBs never arrived, or they
  arrived and are somewhere he has not walked to. Only the first has a number and this is it;
  `WP NO SPOTS`, `WP CROWD n/m` and `WP CROWD FAILED` carry the rest.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** the collision GLB is draco and nothing in this container can
  decode a mesh, so **the sweep has never run outside a browser** -- whether 27 bodies read as a
  populated city, whether they land on pavements rather than in the middle of the freeway, and
  whether her circuit closes at all are device questions. Both gates pass in both worlds
  (`MEL_WORLD=weirdport npm run check:boot`), and headless the sweep correctly finds nothing and
  says `WP NO SPOTS` rather than throwing. `mel.WP.crowd` is live and wants a reload.
  **NOT DONE, AND EACH BECAUSE HE SAID SO:** different jobs, different behaviours, zones, and the
  rule that humans are afraid of you unless you look like one. That last is `foeTarget`'s aggro
  rule and has been a stated gap since m112; it is the same sentence pointed at a city rather than
  at a test site.
- **THE BUILDING TINT IS IN `COLOR_1`, AND THREE NEVER READS THAT ATTRIBUTE (m126, `wpTintSet`,
  `WP.tint`).** *"I meant tints. The roads are building. The buildings and roads aren't tinted."*
  Two faults and m125 only answered one: the ROADS were the forty-one colourless materials, and
  the BUILDINGS are this -- **the City_Trim tint has never once been drawn, and could not have
  been.** His exporter wrote a flat white `COLOR_0` and put the real per-building colour in a
  SECOND colour set; `GLTFLoader`'s `ATTRIBUTES` map has a row for `COLOR_0` and none for
  `COLOR_1`, so it falls through to `gltfAttributeName.toLowerCase()` and lands as
  `geometry.attributes.color_1` -- **a name three has never heard of.** `vColor` was therefore
  white on every vertex and `mix(d, d * vColor, mask)` is an exact no-op on every texel of every
  building. Decoded out of the draco geometry rather than argued:
      COLOR_0   1.000, 1.000, 1.000 on **100% of 43,310 vertices** -- ONE distinct value
      COLOR_1   33 distinct colours -- periwinkle .447/.447/.890 (11.4%), brick .478/.216/.133
                (7.2%), dark red (4.2%), near-black (3.3%), mint, teal: the CITY
  **AND THE OTHER TWELVE CITY_TRIM GEOMETRIES ARE CORRECTLY FLAT, WHICH IS WHAT SAYS THIS IS AN
  EXPORT FAULT AND NOT A GUESS.** Of the 13: **0 have a varying COLOR_0**, exactly **1 has a
  varying COLOR_1** (`vis_city_trim`, 43,310 of 45,578 verts, **95%**), and the twelve props --
  AC fans, garden beds -- are white in both sets, which is right, because a prop keeps its
  painted texture untinted. **His own reference shader says the tint lives in `COLOR_0`**
  (`models/portland/three/weirdportCity.js`, line 2), so this is the export disagreeing with his
  own note rather than a convention anybody chose.
  **THE TEST IS STRUCTURAL AND SELF-DISARMING**, `WP.paint`'s rule one attribute over: a geometry
  is promoted only when it HAS a `color_1` that varies AND its `color` is absent or flat white.
  A re-export that puts the tint back in `COLOR_0` stops matching **one geometry at a time**,
  with nothing here to remove and no material name to keep in step -- `stripPoses`' own test
  (the property that makes the thing what it is, never a name).
  **ONCE PER GEOMETRY, NEVER ONCE PER NODE.** 368 of the 510 visual nodes share 40 meshes, so a
  per-node pass would scan the same 43,310 vertices over and over; deduped by `geometry.uuid` it
  is one scan at load. **`getX` DENORMALIZES in r180**, so the ushort-normalized attribute reads
  back 0..1 and "is it flat white" is the same question either way; itemSize 4 defines
  `USE_COLOR_ALPHA` and makes `vColor` a vec4, which the splice already reads as `.rgb`.
  **AND THE COLOUR SPACE IS AN OPEN QUESTION, SO IT IS A SWITCH RATHER THAN A DECISION.** glTF
  says `COLOR_n` is LINEAR and his reference shader multiplies it raw, which is what ships --
  but .447 is 114/255 and the palette reads like sRGB bytes an eye picked. `mel.tint(1)` puts
  `pow(c, 2.2)` in front of it. **A uniform, not a define**, so it is an A/B on the phone with
  no recompile, no rebuild and no push: a look-at-it decision belongs where he can look at it,
  which is this file's oldest standing rule about taste.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS WHICH OF THE TWO BUGS IT IS.** *"The buildings aren't tinted"* is the
  material never getting the mask OR getting it and `vColor` being white, and those are one
  picture from a phone: `WP NO TRIM MAT` answers the first and **`WP NO TINT`** the second, with
  `WPTINT<n>` counting the geometries promoted. It goes quiet the day a re-export makes it
  unnecessary, which is `rollREC`'s rule -- the silence IS the confirmation.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** the GLB is draco and there is no GPU here, so **whether the
  city now reads as tinted is a device question**, and so is which colour space is right. What
  CAN be checked here was: the attribute names, the 13 geometries' colour sets, the distinct
  values in each, and that both gates pass in both worlds. `mel.WP.tint = 0` is m125 exactly.
- **FORTY-ONE MATERIALS CARRY NO BASE COLOUR AT ALL, AND glTF'S DEFAULT IS WHITE (m125,
  `WP.paint`).** *"None of the roads or buildings are coming in. Is that something we're missing?
  Everything else looks good so far as I can tell."* They are all there and they are all
  `#ffffff`, against a background and a fog of `0xe7edf5` -- which is exactly what a road you
  cannot see looks like. Read straight out of `weirdport_slice_visual_draco.glb`:
      150 materials   7 with a baseColorTexture   102 with a baseColorFactor   **41 with NEITHER**
      and every one of those 41 has a roughness and/or a metalness set
  **SO IT IS AN EXPORT FAULT AND NOT A DESIGN, WHICH IS WHAT THE ROUGHNESS SAYS.** Somebody set
  the surface and the colour did not survive the write. His own note says the ground materials
  *"export as flat colors for now until baked to textures"*; they do not export as flat colours,
  they export with none -- so the one thing he believed was already true is the thing that was
  missing, which is why the report reads as geometry rather than as paint.
  **AND THE SPLIT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE CAN AND CANNOT SEE.** What is textured is the 368 `inst_`
  nodes -- trees, cars, benches, street assets, tree wells -- plus every `vis_` material that did
  keep a factor (the neon, the murals, the lit glass). What is colourless is Asphalt, Sidewalk,
  Lot/DIY/Seawall concrete, both grasses, Soil, Riverbank_Dirt, the pavers and the steps,
  Brick_Red, both stuccos, both roofs, Timber, Stone_Trim, both window frames, the awnings and
  the five food carts. **The roads and the low-rise buildings, and nothing else.**
  **THE TEST IS STRUCTURAL AND IT HAS NO FALSE POSITIVES**, measured rather than assumed: **not
  one material in the file carries an explicit white `baseColorFactor`**, so "no map and the
  colour is exactly white" names those 41 and nothing else -- 41 rows against 41 materials,
  checked both ways round. `stripPoses`' rule (the property that makes the thing what it is,
  never a name) applied to a material.
  **AND IT IS SELF-DISARMING, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SAFE TO SHIP A STAND-IN AT ALL.** The day he
  re-exports with real colours a material stops matching, **one material at a time**, with
  nothing here to remove and no second source of truth to keep in step -- `weapFit`'s rule, one
  asset along. **The chip says `WPPAINT<n>` while any of it is in use and goes quiet the moment
  it is not**, so the silence IS the confirmation that the export landed (`rollREC`'s rule).
  **THE HEXES ARE READ OFF HIS OWN NAMES, NOT ART-DIRECTED FROM HERE** -- `Brick_Red`,
  `Stucco_Lavender`, `Tile_Mint`, `Portland_Green_Metal` -- and a colourless material with no row
  takes `paint0`, so nothing can ever be left blown out. `setHex` decodes sRGB into working
  space, which is what an eye-picked hex wants (the Portland repo's own vertex-colour lesson).
  `mel.WP.paint = null` is the one word back to what he is looking at now.
- **AND THE HAZE WAS TUNED FOR A TEST SITE YOU CAN SEE ACROSS (m125, `WP.fog`).** 40 m to fully
  opaque at 150 is right for a white floor and ten boxes and hides half of a 280 x 250 m city:
  the far edge of the slice is 140 m from the spawn and downtown is further. 70 to 320 leaves
  the far edge at 21% and 200 m out at 39%, which is depth rather than a wall. **`camera.far` is
  already 400 and needed nothing.**
  **IT IS A SECOND AND SEPARATE FAULT AND IS CHANGED AS ITS OWN VARIABLE**, because a build that
  moves two things at once is a build neither of which can be judged -- and with a white city he
  could not have judged the fog anyway. `mel.WP.fog = null` keeps the test site's range.
- **WEIRDPORT: A SECOND WORLD, AND THE FIRST THING IN THIS GAME A BOX COLLIDER CANNOT EXPRESS
  (m124, `WORLD`, `WP`, `TRI`, `BGRID`, `buildWpCollision`, `buildWpVisual`).** *"There's a
  folder called Portland. It's a slice of a map I've been creating in Blender... let's make a
  separate mode you can choose like the main mode. This will just be a new test mode you can
  jack into. We want to set up the environment first and get all that right. But basically, you
  can just have my character in there and make him able to walk around."*
  **AND THE FILES WERE ON `origin` AND NOT IN MY CLONE.** `git log` said the last three commits
  were mine; `git fetch` brought down six of his, including two that DELETE a first, misplaced
  copy at `models/portland/*.glb`. The real ones are under `slice_downtown/`. m107's lesson,
  paid a second time: **`git log` answers a question about the LOCAL clone, and after a push of
  your own the local head is exactly as far behind as it was before.** Fetch before concluding
  a file never arrived.
- **THE CHOICE IS MADE AT BOOT AND IT RELOADS, WHICH IS NOT A SHORTCUT (m124).** The test site
  is built at MODULE SCOPE and Weirdport is ten megabytes of GLB, so the two cannot both be
  standing and tearing one down to raise the other is a second build path to keep in step with
  the first. A reload is one path. The key sits under the build chip -- out of the play area, in
  the same gutter, one tap, with the world's NAME on it -- which is `actB`'s rule that a prompt
  drawn on the control performing it cannot be a mode you are in without knowing it. `?w=test`
  is the way back if a world ever fails to boot: **a link can be sent where a gesture has to be
  explained**, which is `?fresh`'s own argument one repo over. `mel.world('weirdport')` on a
  desktop.
- **A BOX TOP IS FLAT, SO A BOX COLLIDER CANNOT EXPRESS A RAMP (m124, `TRI`).** Every collider
  in this game until now has been an AABB, which is right for a test site of cubes and cannot
  describe five DIY banks at 34 degrees, terrain climbing to 17 m or a freeway deck at 9.2. So
  Weirdport's walkable surfaces go in as TRIANGLES -- world space, a 4 m XZ grid,
  point-in-triangle -- and `groundAt` asks both stores and takes the higher.
  **ANYTHING STEEPER THAN `TRI.up` IS THROWN AWAY, WHICH DOES THREE JOBS AT ONCE.** A ramp's
  SIDE WALLS are not in the collider, so meet one side-on and you pass through it and roll at it
  up the slope and you ride it -- **a ramp is a floor, not a solid**, which is the alternative
  to a box you stop dead against. The same line drops every UNDERSIDE, because these meshes are
  closed solids: **3,132 of their 13,762 triangles face DOWN** and 6,850 more are the kerbs and
  retaining walls at the slabs' edges. 3,684 survive, and they are exactly the deck.
  **AND IT RETURNS TWO ANSWERS BY CONSTRUCTION, WHICH IS WHY A DECK NEEDED NO CASE.** The
  highest surface at or a step above his feet: measured at one point under the I-405, standing
  at y 0 it answers **0.00** and standing at y 11 it answers **11.00**.
  **VERIFIED AGAINST EVERY TRIANGLE IT WAS BUILT FROM**, by lifting the shipped text between the
  `TRICOL:` markers and driving it with the real file -- a harness with its own copy of the rule
  measures a game that does not exist, and this repo has made that mistake more than any other.
  Standing at each of the 3,684 centroids and asking for the ground: **3,290 exact, 394
  overlapped by something higher, 0 wrong or missing.** Walkable slopes run to 58.2 degrees, and
  every one of the five ramps rises continuously from its foot to its lip
  (`ramp_diy_bank_a` 0.22 -> 2.42 in even steps).
  **AND MY FIRST TWO PROBES OF THOSE RAMPS BOTH MEASURED MY OWN SAMPLING.** One asked for the
  ground with a step of 6 m and got the freeway deck at 11 (the DIY spot is UNDER the I-405);
  the other walked across a bank along the axis it is flat in and read 0.22 the whole way. Both
  read as the collider failing and neither was. **The question that cannot be aimed wrongly is
  "does it reproduce what it was built from"**, which is the one above.
- **A BOUNDING BOX IS NOT A BUILDING, AND HERE IT IS NOT A MATTER OF DEGREE (m124).**
  `solid_freeway_piers_col` is ONE node -- a row of separate piers under the I-405 -- whose
  bounding box is **155 x 229 m and 9 m tall**. As an AABB that is a solid block over most of
  the slice from the ground up and **the player could not have moved at all.** So `solid_` and
  `bld_` go through `solidColumns`, m26's own rasteriser, and it costs 77 ms for 179 meshes.
  **A 12-TRIANGLE MESH IS A BOX AND ITS AABB IS EXACT, so it skips the rasteriser** -- and that
  is a STRUCTURAL test rather than a test on `prop_`. 329 of his 333 props really are boxes (his
  note: *"props are simple boxes; trees are 0.7 m trunk boxes 3 m tall"*) and the four that are
  not go through with the buildings, which is what a name test would have got wrong in both
  directions. `stripPoses`' rule, one asset along.
- **AND `full` ALONE SAYS A BEAM IS ITS OWN BOUNDING BOX (m124, `cfg.fill`).** The collapse test
  asks whether the OCCUPIED columns are full height and quietly assumes the footprint is
  occupied -- which is true of every closed building shell it has ever been handed and false of
  a beam, a row of piers or a fence. `solid_freeway_girder_col` is 276 x 250 m and 1.8 m thick,
  so every column it has spans its whole height, `boxy / used` is 1, and **it collapsed into a
  SLAB OVER THE ENTIRE MAP at 9.2 m** -- an invisible floor that a man on a roof, on a ledge or
  on the hill lands on. `fill` is the other half of the question. Measured over the whole slice:
      fill 0     4003 boxes, 26 collapsed, biggest box **68,885 m2**  (the girder)
      fill .5    4086 boxes, 21 collapsed, biggest box **676 m2**     (a real building plan)
  **ABSENT IT IS PROVABLY THE OLD RULE** -- `cfg.fill || 0` and `used >= 1` by the `if (!used)`
  three lines above -- so `BLD` and `TOWER`, which name no `fill`, are untouched.
- **FIVE FUNCTIONS SCANNED `BOXES` LINEARLY, WHICH IS RIGHT FOR TEN AND NOT FOR 4,086 (m124,
  `BGRID`, `boxesNear`).** `groundAt`, `resolveBoxes`, `wallFind`, `ledgeFind` and `camHit` all
  walked the whole list, several times a frame. They read a grid BUCKET now and **the loop
  bodies are untouched**: this is a broad phase and nothing else, the way a car's AABB is the
  broad phase for its oriented box one repo over. Measured over 40,000 random queries against
  the real 4,086: **0 boxes missed**, and the scan drops from 4,086 to a mean of **9.8** -- 0.24%
  of the list, worst case 235.
  **IT IS OFF UNDER `BGRID.min`, so the test site is byte-for-byte what it was.** A grid over
  ten boxes is slower than scanning ten boxes, and the world that already works must not change.
  **EACH CALL SITE OWNS ITS OWN BUFFER, AND THAT IS NOT TIDINESS.** `ledgeFind` calls `camHit`
  INSIDE its own loop over the boxes, so one shared scratch array would be emptied under it half
  way through and the ledge search would silently stop after its first candidate. A pool sized
  by counting the nesting is a thing to get wrong later; five named arrays cannot alias.
  **AND `resolveBoxes`'s QUERY IS PADDED, because that loop MOVES `p` as it goes.** The pad is
  sized to the PUSH rather than to the worst case -- the worst case is 13 m, half the plan of the
  widest building, reachable only from its exact centre -- and past it the failure is ONE FRAME
  of not being shoved out of a SECOND box, which the next frame resolves from his new position.
  A pad of a whole grid cell scans 40.8 boxes a query where 2 m scans 13.0, for a margin nothing
  ever uses.
- **THE SPAWN IS SEARCHED, NEVER TYPED -- AND THE ORIGIN IS INSIDE A BUILDING (m124).** (0, 0)
  is inside `bld_dt_18_col`, so the one coordinate anybody would have picked by eye puts him in
  a tower. Swept against the real collider for the widest patch of clear level ground within
  60 m of the middle: **(-6, 6) on `ground_asphalt_col`, y 0.00, 14 m of clearance in every
  direction** -- the hero intersection. `npm run spots`' rule one repo over, and here it is the
  difference between a world and a man in a wall.
  **AND IT IS SET IN `init()`, NOT AT MODULE SCOPE**, because the ground he is about to stand on
  does not exist until the collider does.
- **HIS EXPORTER PUT THE TINT MASK IN THE BASE COLOUR SLOT AND LEFT THE PAINTED SHEET OUT
  (m124).** Read off the file: `City_Trim`'s `baseColorTexture` is `weirdport_trim_tintmask`, and
  `weirdport_trim_basecolor.png` -- the 2048 his manifest says the window tiles need -- **is not
  embedded at all**. Loaded as it stands, every building in the city is shaded with a black and
  white mask. The mask is exactly what the shader wants, just not where the shader wants it: it
  is kept AS the mask and `map` becomes the real sheet, fetched beside the picture so a 2048
  that does not arrive costs the buildings their paint rather than the whole city.
  **THE MASK IS THE EMBEDDED ONE, so there is no second fetch and no second failure mode on the
  boot path.** `textures/weirdport_trim_tintmask.png` is the lossless 1024 copy if the JPEG's
  ringing ever shows at a window frame.
  **AND HIS REFERENCE SHADER TESTS `City_Trim_Export` WHILE THIS EXPORT CALLS THE MATERIAL
  `City_Trim`** -- so on this file it would have matched nothing at all. The shader itself is
  his (`models/portland/three/weirdportCity.js`) and is otherwise used as written.
  **`#ifdef USE_COLOR` FIRES FOR A VEC4 COLOUR TOO**, checked in the vendored source rather than
  assumed: three defines `USE_COLOR` whenever `vertexColors` is true and adds `USE_COLOR_ALPHA`
  on top, and `vColor.rgb` is valid on both the vec3 and the vec4.
  **THE TRIM SHEET IS THE BIGGEST THING IN THE SLICE** -- 5.8 MB on the wire and about **22 MB
  resident** with its mips. `gltf-transform uastc` to KTX2 takes that to about 5.6 the day the
  count makes it matter; it is one texture today.
- **368 OF THE 510 VISUAL NODES ARE INSTANCES AND THE EXPORTER DID NOT SAY SO (m124).** No
  `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`, so 368 trees, cars, benches and lamp banners arrive as separate
  nodes sharing **40 meshes** -- 368 draw calls for 40 distinct things, and draw calls are the
  first thing that costs anything on a phone. They are merged into one `InstancedMesh` each.
  **GROUPED BY GEOMETRY *AND* MATERIAL**, because two nodes sharing a mesh but not a material
  are not one draw call.
  **THE MATERIAL PASS RUNS BEFORE THE BATCH, AND THAT IS NOT AN ORDERING PREFERENCE.** The batch
  REMOVES the nodes it merges, so a pass after it never sees them -- and `G_PF_Garden_Bed` and
  `G_PF_Garden_Bush` are instanced AND are **City_Trim**. Run the other way round, a third of
  the city misses the trim sheet, the tint mask, the anisotropy and its shadow flags, and
  nothing on screen says which third. Caught reading the diff, not running it.
  **AND THE INSTANCED MESH CARRIES ITS SOURCE'S SHADOW FLAGS AND ITS OWN BOUNDS**, because it is
  a NEW object: a tree pack spread over the slice never leaves the frustum and loses nothing by
  being tested, while twelve garden bushes in one plaza are a tight sphere and cull everywhere
  else in the city.
- **A 44 METRE SHADOW CAMERA IN A 280 METRE CITY WORKS IN ONE CORNER OF IT (m124, `stepSun`).**
  Fixed at the origin it covers about two and a half per cent of Weirdport, so his own shadow --
  the thing that grounds him -- would simply stop existing a few steps from the spawn. It
  follows him, which keeps the 2048 map at **46 texels per metre** rather than spreading it over
  a district at four. **The offset is the sun's own direction**, so the light keeps its bearing
  and only the box it covers moves; writing a position without moving the target swings the sun
  round the sky as he walks.
  **THE CITY RECEIVES SHADOWS AND DOES NOT CAST THEM (`WP.cast`).** 182 casting meshes is a
  shadow pass of 182 more draws, and an InstancedMesh's bounds span the slice so most of them
  would never cull out of it. His own shadow still lands on the street, which is the half that
  matters. `mel.WP.cast = 1` is the A/B.
- **AND THE BOOT GATE CAN BE POINTED AT EITHER WORLD (m124, `MEL_WORLD`).** The Weirdport branch
  is a path no gate had ever evaluated -- and a `const` read above its own declaration in there
  is a blank page exactly as it is anywhere else, which is this file's oldest landmine and the
  one `check:boot` exists for. `MEL_WORLD=weirdport npm run check:boot`. Empty is the test site,
  so `npm run check` is unchanged.
  **WHAT NO GATE HERE CAN REACH IS EITHER BUILDER**, because headless every `loadGLB` rejects --
  so `buildWpCollision` and `buildWpVisual` have never run outside a browser. What IS measured
  is everything they hand to: the shipped `triAdd`/`triBuild`/`triGround` over the real file, the
  shipped `solidColumns` over the real solids, and the shipped `boxGrid`/`boxesNear` over the
  real 4,086 boxes. The classification, the traverse and the draco decode are device questions.
  **THE CHIP CARRIES `WP<tris>t/<boxes>b`**, because *"the city never loaded"*, *"it loaded and
  I fall through the road"* and *"it loaded and I cannot move"* are three bugs and one picture
  from a phone, and only those two numbers tell them apart. Expect **WP3684t/4086b**.
- **NOT IN WEIRDPORT, AND EACH FOR A REASON (m124).** No NPCs: every warrior, drunk, skater,
  biker and Clancy is placed at a coordinate chosen against the TEST SITE, and a body spawned
  inside a tower is the m24 lesson (nothing on screen disagrees with anything and the player
  simply cannot walk there). Placing them wants the same sweep the spawn got, and it is its own
  build. **No grind rails**: his ten handrails, ledge irons and coping are found and counted
  (`WP.rails`, keyed on the `metal` MATERIAL, which is the one thing separating them from the
  concrete they are bolted to) and **this game has no grind mechanic at all**, so they are a
  hook and nothing reads them. **No ground textures**: his own note says the asphalt, sidewalk
  and grass export as flat colours until he bakes them, which is the first thing anybody will
  notice and is his export rather than this code.
  **AND THE PICTURE AND THE THING YOU WALK INTO ARE TWO DIFFERENT MESHES HERE, BY HIS DESIGN.**
  Every other solid in this game pushes its own footprint into `BOXES`, so there is one
  description of the world; this one has two, and the collision file is the one that is true. If
  he reports walking into nothing, that is the gap -- and it is his export to close rather than
  this code's to paper over.
- **A THUMB LIFTING OFF THE GLASS IS NOT A SWIPE, AND NO WINDOW CAN SAY OTHERWISE (m104, `FLICK`).**
  *"I'll press and hold in one direction and then when I release it thinks I've done a swipe
  gesture -- he keeps rolling out of the way when I'm not meaning to. It needs to be both the press
  forward AND the release within a certain timing to make sure that it's a swipe."*
  **THE ARM-THEN-LIFT SHAPE WAS RIGHT AND THE NUMBERS WERE NOT.** A finger leaving the screen drags
  its contact centroid as the patch shrinks -- twenty to forty pixels of it, routinely -- and on a
  52 px radius that is up to **.77 of the pad, arriving fast and followed immediately by the up**.
  That is geometrically the SAME EVENT as a flick: a quick move and then a lift. **So no timing
  window separates them**, however tight, and the two he asked for (`within` for the sweep, `let`
  for the lift) already existed and were never going to be enough on their own.
  **WHAT IS LEFT IS MAGNITUDE.** `at` .70 is 36 px of travel, which a lift-off produces; .95 is
  49 px, a deliberate sweep across most of the pad, which it does not. The two windows come down
  with it (`within` .28 -> .16, `let` .26 -> .14) so the gesture as a whole has to be quick, which
  is his sentence -- but the number that does the work is the distance.
  **A FLICK STILL FIRES OUT OF A HELD POSITION**, which is the thing that must not be lost: the
  delta is measured over a moving window rather than from the pad's centre, so a thumb four seconds
  into a steering hold still flicks. What it now has to do is cross the pad to do it.
  **AND THE COST IS STATED**: a roll in the direction you are ALREADY holding has less pad left to
  sweep across, so it is harder to ask for than a roll to one side. `mel.FLICK.at` is the dial and
  this is a device question -- nothing in this container has a touchscreen.
- **THE PADS FLOAT, OPTIONALLY -- AND WHEN THEY DO NOT THEY ARE BIGGER (m104, `STICK`, the zones).**
  *"Did we make it so you can have the option of the dynamic stick control, so they move around --
  so you don't have to be super precise with where you're pressing and swiping. And when they're
  not dynamic I think they should be a little bit bigger."* **m49 and m98 both wrote the floating
  pad down as the real fix for missing one and both shipped something else**; m98's own note ends
  *"a pad that appears where the thumb lands makes this question disappear rather than widening its
  answer."*
  **THE ZONE IS THE TARGET AND THE PAD IS THE PICTURE.** Half the screen each, and the pad is moved
  to the touch on the way down -- so `set()` measures the same rect it always did and **every
  gesture below it is unchanged**. The zone is not an ancestor of the arc rows, the chip or any
  key, so a press on one of those never reaches it; and the move/up handlers are registered on the
  zone as well as the pad, because the floating pad is `pointer-events: none` and capture is not a
  guarantee.
  **THE FLICK HISTORY IS SEEDED DIFFERENTLY ON A FLOATING PAD**, which is the one thing that could
  not be shared. On an absolute pad a thumb slammed onto the top edge genuinely IS a flick (m49)
  and the centre seed is what catches it; on a floating pad the thumb IS the centre, and seeding
  from the centre would arm a flick out of the edge clamp on every touch near a screen edge.
  **AND `RAD` IS MEASURED NOW RATHER THAN TYPED.** It was 52 against a 132 px pad, so `--pad` could
  not move without every gesture threshold quietly meaning something else -- which is the whole
  point of making the fixed pads bigger. One ratio, read off the element, and `--pad` 148 fixed /
  132 floating is the only number.
  **AND IT IS A TAP ON THE BUILD BADGE**, because there is no settings panel in this game and a
  phone has no console -- *"the option"* is a look-at-it decision and those belong on the phone
  (`city.opt`'s rule). Only the NUMBER takes the tap, so the state line beside it cannot eat a
  thumb, and it is out of the play area. **It is not a hidden mode**: the pads say which one it is
  in by floating or not, and the chip carries `· FLOAT`.
  **CHECKED AS GEOMETRY, NOT BY EYE (m184's rule).** At `--pad` 148 on a 390 px phone the two pads
  span x 20..168 and 222..370 -- **54 px between them** -- and everything downstream reads
  `--padr`, so the arc rows move with the pad rather than being positioned a second time.
- **ONE ARC-ROW BUILDER, TWO ROWS -- AND CENTRING THEM IS WHAT STOPPED THEM COLLIDING (m104,
  `buildArcRow`, `PALROW`).** *"In the same way that we have the buttons above the right stick, I
  wanna make the equivalent of those on the left stick."* m53's whole geometry was already a
  function of `MODES` and a table, so the left row is the same call with a mirrored bearing and a
  THIRD row tomorrow is another one.
  **AND `MODES.mid` 115 HAD TO GO, WHICH WAS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A PREFERENCE.** It was up and a
  little INWARD because at `--pad` 132 the right pad's centre sits 86 px from the edge of a 390 px
  phone and a set centred on vertical put its outer tip 2.5 px inside it. The pad is 148 now, that
  centre is at 296, and the same tip lands 11 px clear -- **and the lean is what made the two rows
  meet**, because both of them leant toward the middle:
      mid 115 / 65   right row's inner tip x **194**, left row's **196** -- OVERLAPPING, at the
                     same height, by two pixels
      mid 90 both    right's inner tip 212.5, left's 177.5 -- **35 px of air**
  with the outer tips at 379 and 10.5, both on screen at 132 as well as at 148. The left row is
  written as `180 - MODES.mid` rather than as 90, so moving one moves the other and they can never
  lean toward each other again.
  **AND A ROW WEARS ITS OWN STICK'S HUE**, for the reason the pads do (m49): they are different
  controls, and a row in the other pad's colour reads as belonging to the other pad.
- **CLANCY RIDES THE BACKPACK (m104, `PACK`, `packGo`, `stepPack`).** *"One of them is gonna be to
  control Clancy -- I want to push a button and he's gonna run and jump onto my backpack and just
  sit on it. One for him roaming and one that's like a backpack."*
  **NEARLY ALL OF IT WAS ALREADY BUILT, WHICH IS `d.K`'S DIVIDEND AGAIN.** The run over is the
  leash's own catch-up with the ring's centre moved from "beside you" to "you"; the leap is
  `bodyFly`, the integrator every hop and knock-down already uses; the pose is one clip name; and
  the two modes are a table the arc row builds itself off. What is actually new is where he SITS
  and the state that holds him there.
  **HE RIDES A BONE, NOT A POINT BESIDE THE PLAYER.** `rig.bones` is already a name map (the aim
  pose reads Spine1/Spine2 out of it), so hanging him off the spine means he takes the walk's bob,
  the turn and every crouch for free -- where an offset from `player.pos` is a small man sliding
  along in the air behind a body moving under him. Found by PATTERN, the jetpack's rule one repo
  over. **And he is WRITTEN, never parented**: the armature is scaled 0.01 and a child of it comes
  out at a hundredth of its size (m26), and this needs no parent anyway because it is a position
  and a facing. `seat.up`/`seat.back` are fractions of `RIG.height`, so a change to how big the
  player is moves the seat with him (m52).
  **THE LEAP IS SOLVED FOR THE SEAT, NOT FOR AN APEX SOMEBODY TYPED.** At `leap` .30 s and g 20,
  `vy = (dy + g T^2 / 2) / T` puts him at the seat's height exactly at T -- which on these numbers
  is also the top of his arc, so he arrives at the top of his own leap, which is what landing on a
  back is. `leapDrag` 0 is what keeps the horizontal exact (m74).
  **AND ONE PREDICATE ANSWERS BOTH HALVES (`packOK`).** The ride reads it to decide whether to HOLD
  him and the approach reads it to decide whether to GO -- so without `player.knock` in the SAME
  test the knock-down threw him off and `foeWander` put him straight back on the next frame, which
  is a man bouncing off your back rather than coming off it. The probe read it exactly:
  `after a knock-down: st=ride`.
  **A PASSENGER HAS NO BRAIN**, so the pack runs above every other state rather than inside
  `foeAI`: no gait, no dive, no target, and nothing to be separated from. And he is out of
  `pushBodies` and `bodySep` while he rides -- without that he is a solid held 21 cm in front of
  your own chest shoving you backwards every frame, which reads as walking into an invisible box
  and is the same thing m96's carry had to skip.
  **A BLOW STILL TAKES HIM OFF AND THAT NEEDED NO CASE**: `dummyBlow` sets `st` to `hit` or `down`
  and the ride only holds on `ride`, so shooting the passenger drops him.
  Driven through the shipped `stepDummies` over the real collider:
      PACK from 6 m    runs in, leaps, **aboard at 2.50 s**, y 1.13 against a seat of 1.13,
                       0.21 m behind you in plan
      you walk 12 m    he is at 11.77 with dy 1.13 -- still seated, still behind
      ROAM             down on the ground, y 0.35 against a ground of 0.35
      PACK again       aboard
      a knock-down     **off**, and he re-boards once you are up
  **THE THROW IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE.** *"And then I'll be able to like throw him -- but for now
  one for roaming and one that's like a backpack."* m99 deleted the whole carry because *"the
  hybrid animations look like trash, the hips rotation has been stripped, he's leaning forward and
  the throw mechanics are bad -- we need to rebuild all that"*, and none of that has been redrawn.
  `hold_item` and `throw_item` are still in the player's export and still cost nothing unnamed
  (m35's rule), so the throw is a build on top of this one.
  **AND THE ROW IS ON THE LEFT STICK**, which is what the sentence opens with -- *"the equivalent
  of those on the left stick"* -- rather than the "above the right stick" it ends with. Stated
  because it is a reading, not a measurement.
- **THE FAT BIKER AND HIS MOTORCYCLE, AND HIS C4D QUESTION IS GIMBAL LOCK IN THE DISPLAY (m107,
  `BIKER`, `MOTO`, `buildMoto`, `stepMoto`, `stepRide`).** *"I added a guy called fat biker 02 and
  his motorcycle... the motorcycle has its wheels rigged to a bone each and can be driven
  procedurally, and its handlebars rigged to 'turn' I think, and it needs to procedurally have its
  turn driven to 20 degrees each direction. The weird thing about the joint is that when I rotate
  the blue axis it changes R.B, when I rotate the red axis it changes R.P, but when I spin the
  green axis -- the one that turns the steering -- ALL THREE change. It makes no sense?"*
  **THE RIG IS FINE AND THE DISPLAY IS WHAT IS LYING.** C4D's HPB applies H about Y, then P about
  X, then B about Z, in that order -- and the `steering` joint's rest carries **P = -28.5 deg**,
  which is the fork RAKE he modelled. So the joint's own local Y is tilted 28.5 degrees back from
  the parent's Y, a turn about the fork is not a pure H in the parent's frame, and the solver has
  to spread it across all three fields. It is the degenerate case of an Euler triple, not a broken
  joint. **And none of it survives the export: glTF stores QUATERNIONS**, so the game never reads
  a Euler at all and there is nothing here to work around.
  **AND THE STEERING AXIS IS MEASURED RATHER THAN TYPED, WHICH IS WHY THE RAKE COSTS NOTHING.**
  `front_wheel` hangs off `steering` at local (-1.7, -28.3, +3.2) -- almost pure **-Y** -- so the
  fork runs down that joint's own local Y and that is the axis. The rest quaternion is captured at
  build time and the turn rides ON TOP of it (`rest * Ry(d)`, which is exactly a rotation about
  the axis the rest pose puts Y on), so the 28.5 degrees is the export's business. `barPlace`'s
  rule: read the rest pose, never restate it.
  **HE BUILT MORE INTO IT THAN HE REMEMBERED.** 8 nodes, one skin: `root > steering > front_wheel`,
  `back_wheel`, and **`mixamorig_hips` -- a rider SEAT MARKER already in the file.** The steering
  joint is called `steering` and not `turn`, so every joint is found BY PATTERN and either
  spelling lands with no code change -- `weapFit`'s rule.
  **EVERY NUMBER IS DERIVED, AND A REAL-WORLD FACT IS THE CHECK THAT THEY ARE RIGHT.** The bike
  and the biker came out of the same scene, so at `MOTO.len` 2.20 m the geometry gives x2.021
  against the biker's own x2.026 -- and then:
      wheelbase   0.793 authored -> **1.602 m**
      wheel r     0.136           -> **0.275 m**   a Fat Boy's front tyre is 0.28
      seat        0.323           -> **0.652 m**   a Fat Boy's seat is 0.66
  Two independent real-world facts land within a centimetre, which is what says the scale is right
  rather than plausible.
  **THE STEER ANGLE FALLS OUT OF THE WHEELBASE.** A single-track vehicle turning at yaw rate w
  while doing v has a turn radius v/w, so `delta = atan(L*w/v)` -- the handlebars answer the corner
  rather than a mapping somebody invented, and **`lock` is his 20 degrees as a CLAMP** rather than
  as a target. At the shipped ring that is 6.5 deg; `mel.MOTO.ring.r = 6` takes it to 15.0 and at
  4.4 m it reaches the lock. The wheels are distance over the measured radius about each bone's
  own local X -- the axle, because the mesh is 1.089 long in Z against 0.648 wide in X -- and the
  front wheel inherits the steering for free by being its CHILD in the file.
  **THE CIRCUIT WAS SWEPT, NOT CHOSEN, AND THE ANSWER WAS NEARLY "THERE IS NO ROOM".** A path here
  has to clear fourteen boxes, two buildings and seventeen bodies. The largest clear ring within
  reach of the spawn is **14 m at (-29, -3)**, worst clearance 2.02 m, nearest point 15 m from
  where he stands; the only clear OVAL is 64 m across with its nearest point 37 m away, which is a
  motorcycle you cannot see. **The path is parameterised by angle rather than integrated**, so it
  cannot drift into anything however long it runs.
  **AND THE RIDER IS `stepPack` ONE VEHICLE OVER.** `'ride'` is a state `pushBodies` and `bodySep`
  ALREADY skip, so reusing it is what makes a passenger weightless for free; he is written to the
  seat BONE every frame with no offset, and the three driving clips blend by how hard it is
  steering, summing to exactly 1. **`stepMoto` runs ABOVE `stepDummies`**, because the rider reads
  the seat bone's world position and a bike stepped after him leaves him a frame behind it --
  `stepShip`'s ordering rule.
  **AND `packOff`'s LOOP WAS NOT GATED ON THE PAL, WHICH THIS EXPOSED.** `if (!packWant()) for
  (const d of DUMMIES) if (d.st === 'ride') packOff(d)` walks EVERY body, so pressing the pal row
  would have thrown a biker off his bike. Latent until there was a second thing that rides.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** the motorcycle is draco and nothing in this container can decode
  a mesh or build a skin, so `buildMoto` has never run outside a browser -- whether it stands the
  right way up, whether the wheels spin about the axis the arithmetic says, and which way it heels
  are device questions. The arithmetic that CAN be checked -- the scale, the wheelbase, the radius,
  the seat, the steer angles and the ring's clearances -- is above and was. The chip carries
  `MOTO<deg>` plus `MOTO NO STEER` / `NO WHEEL` / `NO SEAT` if a re-export renames a joint, because
  "the wheels don't turn", "the bars don't turn" and "it never loaded" are one picture from a phone.
  **`models/vehicles` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- `readdirSync` is not recursive, so a
  new asset folder is a new entry there or every file in it goes stale silently. **Seventh time.**

- **AN EARLY-RETURN BRANCH NEEDS SOMEBODY TO CALL THE FUNCTION AGAIN (m123, `stepMorph`).** *"It
  puts you into a mode as though you're disarmed and yet it shows it like you're holding the
  weapon... your gun is out but it thinks you're in disarmed mode, and then you have to take out
  your gun even though you already have it out."* Both halves of that are one call that never
  happened.
  **`paintKit` IS CALLED FROM `mphWear`, WHICH RUNS AT THE SWAP -- WITH `p.mphSt` STILL SET.** So
  it took m122's transform branch, which blanks the label, blanks the hint, dims the mode row,
  drops `ready` from the pad and **returns before the visibility loop**. That return is why the
  gun stayed drawn: its `visible` was never touched, so the model kept whatever it had while every
  readout beside it said he was carrying nothing. And **nothing called `paintKit` again when the
  flash ended** -- `p.mphSt = ''` sits in a branch that clears five fields, disposes the blob and
  returns -- so the HUD stayed in the transform's state for the WHOLE disguise, until a tap
  happened to repaint it. *"You have to take out your gun even though you already have it out"* is
  that tap, described exactly.
  **THE BRANCH IS RIGHT AND THE GAP IS STRUCTURAL.** A state that suppresses a repaint is only
  half a rule; the other half is repainting when it stops, and the one place that knows the
  transform is over is where it ends. This is the class to check whenever a `paintKit`-shaped
  function grows a guard: **who calls it when the guard goes false.**
- **AND A TRANSFORM ENDS IN A MODE YOU CAN FIRE (m123).** *"Rather than putting you in DNA -- the
  tendency would be, if it shoots you into DNA gun then you're just gonna shoot somebody right
  away and then transform into them even though you just transformed into somebody else."*
  He is describing a loop and it is real: the gun that put you in this body is still the gun in
  your hand, so the very next release puts you in a different one. **The mode a transform lands in
  has to be one whose trigger does not undo the transform**, which is the DNA mode and nothing
  else -- so **AUTO is deliberately left alone**: rapid fire is a perfectly good thing to be
  holding and firing it changes nobody's body.
  **THE SLOT AND THE MODE ARE BOTH FOUND, NEVER TYPED** (`q.aim`, `!q.dna && !q.auto`), which is
  m52's own rule that a fourth weapon or a fourth mode is a row in a table and the line still
  reads. **The slot half is a no-op on every path a player can take** -- you cannot fire the DNA
  gun without the blaster already out, and `cycleKit` refuses while `p.mphSt` is set -- so what it
  actually covers is `mel.dna('hobo')` from the console and whatever a future sample-and-return
  path does. Stated as such rather than dressed up as a fix.
  **AND IT IS GATED ON `p.mphNext`, so only putting a disguise ON moves anything.** A REVERT keeps
  whatever you were carrying, which is what the same rule says pointed the other way: nothing about
  taking a body off is a reason to change the kit.
- **THE LEDGE HANG WAS MEASURED ON ZAP AND DRAWN ON SOMEBODY ELSE (m122, `bodyK`).** *"For some
  reason, all of the characters do the ledge hang too high, like from their hips it seems."*
  Exactly that, and it is one ratio. `LEDGE.hang` .861 and `LEDGE.out` .170 are fractions of
  `RIG.height` **measured off zap's own hang clip** -- his hands sit 1.076 m above his root -- and
  `MORPH.tall` draws a disguise at the KIND's own height while the collider, the speeds and
  `MOVE.step` stay his. So the root went to `lip - 1.076` on a body whose hands are `k` times
  further up than that, and the whole difference hung over the lip:
      zap      h 1.25  k 1.000   hands at the lip  +0.000   the lip at **86%** of him
      skater   h 1.68  k 1.344                     +0.370               64%   <- his screenshot
      hick     h 1.78  k 1.424                     +0.456               60%
      warrior  h 1.85  k 1.480                     +0.517               58%
      clancy   h 0.62  k 0.496                     **-0.542**          174%   <- over his head
  86% of a body is his hands; 60% is his hips, which is the word he used. Scaled, it is 0.000 at
  every height and Clancy stops hanging off a lip half a metre above his own crown.
  **AND THE CATCH BAND HAD TO MOVE WITH IT.** `ledgeFind` centres the window on where his hands
  END UP -- *"the placement number IS the acquire number and the two cannot drift"* -- so scaling
  only `ledgeAt` would have left the window where zap's hands would be while the pose put the
  skater's 37 cm higher, which is the two halves of one rule disagreeing.
  **IT IS NOT `rig.gaitK`, AND FOLDING IT IN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE `chargeGoH` BUG (m27).** That
  one is set only when the clip BORROW succeeds, because a refused borrow plays the kind's own
  clips at the kind's own reference speeds and the gait must divide by nothing -- and the body is
  drawn just as tall either way. Two facts, two numbers.
  **AND IT WAS ALREADY BEING COMPUTED INLINE.** `stepCam` has scaled its look point by
  `(p.mphH || RIG.height) / RIG.height` since m112; `bodyK()` is that expression with a name, and
  three readers rather than three copies. **A function, not a const** -- `ledgeFind` sits four
  thousand lines above `player` and a const read from up there is a temporal dead zone, which
  this file has paid for eight times.
  **`WALL` IS DELIBERATELY NOT THIS.** `tall`, `chest` and `stand` are a THRESHOLD ("does this box
  hide me") and a standoff measured against his own radius, and the cover pose is a STANDING pose
  -- there is no placement offset to get wrong, so a taller disguise against a wall is still
  against the wall. One variable moved. The same goes for `LEDGE.inset`, `reach` and `hop`, which
  are plan positions against a collider that stays zap's.
- **A DISGUISE CARRIES HIS WEAPONS, ON ITS OWN HAND (m122, `mphMounts`).** *"I can't swap through
  the weapons. I'm wondering if we can just have the characters map the weapon to their hand joint
  since I don't have weapon joints for most of them... we can just map it to their hands until I
  can re-export them with weapon joints."* Read out of the files before a line was written, and
  the reason it works at all is in the first row:
      zap        weapon_root_right  parent **mixamorig_RightHand**  t 3.858, 7.971, -1.553
                 weapon_tip_2       parent weapon_root_right        t -14.310, 0, 0
      warrior    weapon_root        parent mixamorig_RightHand      -- the MACE's, tip +Z 36.18
      hick / hobo / clancy / skater / female     **no weapon nodes at all**
      and every one of the seven has `mixamorig_RightHand`
  Zap's mount is a plain child of his hand with a constant local transform, so copying that
  transform onto another rig's hand puts the gun where he holds it -- and **proportional to the
  wearer**, because the bone chain carries the armature's 0.01 and the model's own scale. That is
  this file's "as authored means proportional" rule one mount over, and on the skater it comes out
  1.22x his, which is right for a body 1.34x his height.
  **THE WARRIOR'S OWN JOINT IS NOT USED, DELIBERATELY.** It is spelt `weapon_root` rather than
  `weapon_root_right`, so the name lookup never asks for it -- and it is the MACE's: its tip is at
  (0, 0, 36.18) against the blaster file's (-14.31, 0, 0), a different axis and a different
  length, so parenting the blaster there would point the barrel sideways.
  **A RIG THAT HAS THE RIGHT JOINT USES THE JOINT**, which is `weapFit`'s rule: `mphMounts`
  collects any `/^weapon_root/` on the skin first, so the day one of these exports carries
  `weapon_root_right` it lands with **no code change here at all**.
  **AND THE TIP COMES WITH IT.** `mountWeapon` reads the barrel AXIS off a `tip` child of the host
  and `barrelH` reads the same pair every frame for the pose correction -- so a mount with no tip
  is a gun with no direction, and `poseBias` would have returned null for the whole disguise.
  **WHICH HAND IS READ OFF ZAP'S OWN MOUNT, NEVER TYPED.** His right one hangs off
  `mixamorig_RightHand` and his left off the left, so one lookup serves both and dual wield needs
  nothing added. The local transform is read LIVE rather than captured, which is safe for the
  reason m35 checked: no mount marker deviates from its rest pose by more than 0.5 deg anywhere in
  the file, and `normaliseClips` has already stripped every non-Hips position track.
  **AND `mountWeapon` RUNS ONCE AT LOAD, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF.** It parents the group to a bone
  PERMANENTLY -- zap's -- so before this every disguise left both weapons hanging off a skeleton
  no longer in the scene, which from a phone is indistinguishable from the kit being switched off.
  `mphWear` re-hosts them by `w.root`, because it is the one place that knows which body is drawn.
  `w.axis` and `w.muzzle` are MOUNT-LOCAL and the synthesised mount carries zap's own transform, so
  neither is re-measured; `w.host` is, because `muzzleWorld` and `barrelH` read it every frame.
  **WHAT THIS CANNOT DO is fit a hand it was not measured on.** Zap's wrist-to-grip offset is his,
  so on a rig whose hands are proportionally a different shape the gun sits a little off -- which
  is exactly the gap his re-export closes, and is why this is a stand-in rather than an answer.
- **AND THE KIT IS LIVE AGAIN WHILE HE IS SOMEBODY ELSE (m122).** *"We need to still be able to
  swap through the weapons when you're like the NPC characters, which the buttons don't show up."*
  Three gates, all written when a disguise genuinely had nothing to play, and all now answered:
      `stepKit`'s early return was `mphOn()` -- wearing ANYBODY -- on the argument that every
      branch below ends in a pose he has not got. That stopped being true at m119, when
      `mphBorrow` put zap's whole pool on the skin: the aim pose, both strafes and the shoot clip
      are all there. It is `mphBare()` now, the same predicate the six verbs took, and it still
      means what it always meant -- no pool to do it with, plus the transform itself.
      `cycleKit`'s m121 inert tap is gone, so the tap means exactly one thing in every state --
      which is the whole point of a control map. REVERT keeps its own button on the left wheel, so
      there is no conflict left to resolve.
      `paintKit`'s disguise branch gave the label line to the character's NAME, because with bare
      hands it was the only thing that line had to say. There is a weapon in his fist now and the
      label is what changes as he taps; WHO he is, is on screen twice already (the chip reads
      `DNA <NAME>` and REVERT is lit), so nothing was lost by giving the line back to the kit.
  **Only the TRANSFORM ITSELF still blanks it**, because for that second there is no body to be
  carrying anything and the ring must not read armed.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS `NOHAND`** when a disguise's mount was never made -- "the mount is missing",
  "it is there and the gun is in the wrong place" and "the kit is switched off" are three bugs and
  one picture from a phone, and only the host answers the first. Silent on every rig in the repo.
- **A BONE COUNT IS A PROXY FOR A STRUCTURE, AND IT FAILED ON THE ONE RIG WITH NO FINGERS
  (m121, `MORPH.needs`).** *"For some reason the animations aren't working on Clancy. I tried
  the homeless guy, the warrior alien -- they worked on those, but they didn't work on Clancy,
  and you can transform into Clancy."* m119 gated the borrow on `borrowMin` **30 shared bones**
  and Clancy has **25**. Read out of his file, his 27 joints are:
      Hips, both UpLeg/Leg/Foot/ToeBase/Toe_End, Spine, Spine1, Spine2, both
      Shoulder/Arm/ForeArm/Hand, Neck, Head, HeadTop_End
  **A complete body, missing nothing a locomotion clip drives** -- what he has not got is
  FINGERS, and zap's 32 finger bones are most of the difference between 62 and 27.
  **THE TEST IS A SPINE, TWO ARMS, TWO LEGS AND A HEAD.** Twenty named joints, matched on the
  SUFFIX so a rig with another prefix still lands (and `LeftUpLeg` does not end with `LeftLeg`,
  nor `LeftHandPinky1` with `LeftHand`, so each names one joint and only one). Checked against
  every rig in the repo: **all nine carry all twenty**, Clancy at 27 joints and the female at
  193 alike. `stripPoses`' own rule -- the test is what the thing IS, never a name or a tally --
  and `dnaOK`'s, which is why the officer is still refused and for the right reason (no walk,
  no run, so no animation set).
  **AND IT NAMES WHAT IS MISSING WHEN IT REFUSES**, which the count could not: "has no
  LeftForeArm" is a fact about an export and "only 25 shared bones, needs 30" is a fact about a
  threshold somebody picked.
- **THE REVERT HAD STOLEN THE ONLY GESTURE THAT CHANGES WEAPONS (m121, `paintPalRow`).** *"Since
  you have the tap on the left stick changing the character back to the alien, I can't change my
  weapons or anything... we need a more clever way to switch back. Maybe a dedicated button pops
  up on the left stick -- you know you have those wheel buttons."*
  m112 spent that tap on the revert on the argument that the kit is bare hands for the whole
  disguise so the gesture was free. **It is not free**, because it is the ONLY way to change
  weapons and a disguise is a state you spend real time in -- so the tap meant a different thing
  depending on a state you were in, which is a gesture you cannot rely on. That is the
  `KIT.on`-with-three-owners shape one control over.
  **SO THE WAY BACK GETS A CONTROL OF ITS OWN, ON A WHEEL THAT ALREADY EXISTS.** `buildArcRow`
  has been a function of a table since m104, so REVERT is a one-row table and the arc simply
  divides once instead of twice -- no new geometry, no new element, nothing in the DOM written
  a second time.
  **IT REPLACES THE PAL ROW RATHER THAN JOINING IT.** ROAM/PACK is a two-state TOGGLE and REVERT
  is an ACTION; a row that mixes them is a row you have to READ rather than glance at, which is
  `optStore`'s "two rows, not a mode" pointed the other way. And while you are wearing somebody
  else, which of the two Clancy is doing is not what needs the screen -- getting back is. It
  comes back the moment you do, with whatever it was still set.
  **AND IT IS BUILT IN `paintPalRow` RATHER THAN IN `buildClancy`**, which is not a tidy-up: a
  session where his GLB never arrived would otherwise have no wheel at all, and therefore no way
  out of a disguise but the console. The row still only shows where it MEANS something
  (`paintKit`'s rule); it is just that "a disguise to get out of" is now one of the things it
  can mean.
  **AND THE TAP IS INERT WHILE DISGUISED RATHER THAN MEANING SOMETHING ELSE.** Cycling into a
  slot `stepKit` refuses to fire would put a weapon in his hand that does nothing, so it simply
  does not cycle -- and the gesture means exactly one thing everywhere, which is the whole point.
  **THE WEAPON SELECTION WANTS ITS OWN BUTTON EVENTUALLY** -- *"they'll probably be a dedicated
  button, but it's fine for now"* -- and when it lands, the left tap frees up entirely.
- **A BODY'S ROOT IS AT ITS SOLES, SO WRITING IT TO A SEAT PUTS HIS FEET ON THE BACKPACK
  (m120, `P.hipY`).** *"This also shows how Clancy sits so far above the backpack."* -- with a
  screenshot of him riding at head height. Measured off the two files rather than nudged a third
  time, composing each rig's bind chain out of the GLB JSON:
      zap     `mixamorig_Spine2` at **0.742 m**, 59% of his 1.25 m   crown 1.25, head bone 0.910
      Clancy  hips **0.156 m** above his own root, head bone 0.337, crown 0.62
      seat    0.742 + RIG.height * .22 = **1.017 m**, and his ROOT went there
      so      his crown landed at **1.64 m** -- 0.39 m OVER zap's own head
  **EVERY NUDGE TO `up` WAS MOVING A NUMBER THAT COULD NOT BE RIGHT**, because the error is the
  rider's own HEIGHT and not an offset: m105 wrote .30 and called the seat a guess, m116 took it
  to .22 and called it a nudge, and neither could ever have closed 39 cm without burying him in
  zap's spine. `packSeat` returns where his ROOT goes now, with his HIPS landing on the seat and
  `P.hipY` saying how far that is -- measured off the proto, which is provably at its bind pose
  because nothing ever animates it, so a bigger sidekick lands right with nothing edited.
  `buildBoard`'s rule one body over: read where the joint actually is and slide the root by the
  difference.
  **AND `up` IS SMALL AND NEGATIVE NOW, WHICH IS WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAYS.** Spine2 is already
  at 59% of his height, so a rider's hips belong a touch UNDER it rather than a quarter of a
  body above: -.034 puts Clancy's hips at 0.700, his root at 0.544 and his own head at **0.881
  against zap's 0.910** -- a creature on his back rather than one hovering over it. He drops
  **0.47 m**.
  **AND A NAMED JOINT TAKES THE CORRECTION TOO**, which is a change from m105's note: a joint
  marks a point ON THE BACKPACK, and that is still where his hips belong rather than where his
  feet do. The export decides the PLACE and this decides which part of him arrives at it -- which
  is the only reading that makes `PACK.mark` drop in with nothing to re-tune.
  **THE POSE IS STILL A STAND-IN AND IS STILL HIS.** `stand_to_cover` is a man taking cover, not
  a man holding on, and it is why he reads as standing to attention on a moving back. `PACK.clips
  .ride` is an ordered list, so drawing one and exporting it as `pack_ride` is the whole change.
- **A BORROWED SKIN WEARS HIS WHOLE MOVESET NOW, ROTATION-ONLY (m119, `mphBorrow`, `mphBare`).**
  *"Once you transform, obviously the new characters don't have all of the same things my hero
  does -- but we could just implement a rotation based borrow of the animation so you can still
  do all of the same stuff. Ignore weapons for now. The general dynamics doesn't even work: you
  can't run, you can't even rotate. I have many times in the past just taken animation, rotation
  only, from one character and applied it to two others -- they're all rigged with Mixamo."*
  **HE IS RIGHT, AND THE FILES SAY HOW RIGHT.** Read out of the GLBs' own JSON chunk (animation
  samplers and node transforms are never draco compressed, so this is measurable here even
  though nothing in this container can decode a MESH). Against zap's 62 bones:
      hick / hobo / skater   57 shared   mean rest offset 1.58 deg   **1 bone over 5 deg**
      alien_warrior          50 (index fingers)          1.80        1
      clancy                 25 (all fingers)            3.61        1
      alien_female_purple    50                          **0.00**    **0**
  **Every rig shares zap's bind pose to 0.00 degrees on every single bone except the Hips**, and
  the five missing on a clean rig are `root` and the four weapon markers -- nothing a locomotion
  clip drives, and nobody sees a finger curl at eight metres.
  **AND THE ONE BONE THAT DIFFERS IS EXACTLY 90.0 DEGREES, STRUCTURALLY.** zap's chain is
  `Armature(+90 X) > root(-90 X) > Hips`; theirs is `Armature(+90 X) > Hips(-90 X)` -- the same
  net world rotation with the turn in a different NODE. **The female is the control that proves
  it**: she HAS a `root` and reads 0.00 at the Hips; the five that have not read 90.0. So the
  whole difference between these rigs is ONE CONSTANT ROTATION at the top of the chain.
  **SO THE DELTA IS APPLIED AT THE HIPS AND NOWHERE ELSE, AND THAT MUST NOT BE RE-DERIVED PER
  BONE.** Shredworld shipped the per-bone form `q_T = q_restT * inv(q_restS) * q_animS`, A/B'd it
  and turned it **off**: per bone it ignores the PARENT-CHAIN term, so the correction compounds
  down each limb -- it splayed Moussa bow-legged and took his arm divergence from 4.6 deg to 33.
  Here there is nothing to compound, because every other bone is 0.00 and the Hips' parent is the
  armature itself, so the chain term above it is the identity and the delta is EXACT rather than
  approximate. `MORPH.restTol` is the guard, not a fudge: the day an export arrives whose elbow
  is twenty degrees off zap's, this is the wrong tool and it refuses and says so.
  **ONE DELTA SERVES THE ROTATION AND THE TRANSLATION, AND THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE.** A bone's
  local rotation composes with its parent's WORLD rotation and its local translation is expressed
  in that same parent frame, so with `D = inv(parentWorld_T) * parentWorld_S`:
      quaternion   q' = D * q                             the world rotation is preserved
      position     p' = t_restT + k * (D * (p - t_restS))  re-expressed in the target's frame
  Verified numerically off the files rather than argued: **`D * zapBindHips` lands on each rig's
  own bind hips to 0.000 degrees, on all six.**
  **AND THE TRANSLATION IS A DELTA FROM REST, NOT A SCALED ABSOLUTE -- WHICH THE MEASUREMENT IS
  WHAT CAUGHT.** `k * (D * p)` is right about the axis that is his HEIGHT (-37.31 against his own
  -37.30 on the hick) and wrong about where the artist put his pelvis relative to the armature
  origin, which is a free choice per export: 2.5 units of 37 off on the hick and **11.5 of 25.6
  on Clancy**, which at his scale is a fifth of a metre of body floating. Taken as a departure
  from rest it is exact at the bind pose on every rig by construction and proportional everywhere
  else -- a 10-unit crouch in zap becomes a 9.30-unit crouch on the hick, which is `10 * k`.
  **AND THE HIPS POSITION IS KEPT RATHER THAN DROPPED, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE "ROTATION ONLY" IS
  WRONG.** That track is the body's HEIGHT OFF THE GROUND and every crouch, landing, roll and
  fall in the set uses it; dropped, the legs fold and the soles hang in the air, which is a bug
  `tools/melee.mjs` paid for one repo over. Every OTHER position track really is a bone LENGTH
  and `normaliseClips` has already thrown those away at load along with every scale track.
  **THE NON-HIPS TRACKS ARE SHARED, NOT COPIED.** A `KeyframeTrack` is immutable data and
  `createInterpolant` allocates a fresh result buffer per action, so one track object backs two
  clips on two skeletons -- which is what makes 50-odd clips per kind cost two small arrays
  rather than a copy of the whole animation set. `normaliseClips` has already cloned every
  `times` array (the worst landmine in this class of file) and nothing mutates one after load.
  **AND THE BIND POSE IS CAPTURED BEFORE THE MIXER EXISTS, COMPOSED UP TO THE MODEL.** A mixer
  overwrites a bone's local transform every frame, so a rest pose cannot be read back off a posed
  skeleton -- and `getWorldQuaternion` would fold in whatever the model is PARENTED to, which the
  two sides of this are not alike in: zap's is already under `rig.root`, whose yaw is written
  every frame, while a freshly cloned skin is under nothing at all. Measuring the two in different
  frames would have been silent and is only not happening today by accident of ordering.
  **AND THEN `rigAnim` IS THE ORDINARY PATH, WHICH IS MOST OF THE RETURN.** `morphAnim` is the
  three clips a kind carries of its own; once zap's pool is on the skin every name in `CLIPS`
  resolves and there is nothing left for a second animation path to do -- the gait, the strafes,
  the backpedal, the landings, the turn hook and the knock-down all arrive at once, and the six
  verbs m112 switched off (`meleeGo`, `rollGo`, `wallGo`, `ledgeGo`, `slamGo`, `backGo`) come back
  by reading `mphBare()` instead of `mphOn()`. **The KIT stays on `mphOn()`**, because a borrowed
  rig genuinely has no weapon mount -- his own *"we could like ignore weapons for now"*.
  **AND THE GAIT HAS TO BE TOLD HOW BIG HE IS (`rig.gaitK`).** A reference speed is how fast the
  PLANTED FOOT slides, which is authored travel TIMES the scale the model is drawn at -- so zap's
  run clip on a hick 42% taller covers 42% more ground per cycle and the feet slide at the same
  world speed. One ratio through `add`'s own `setScale`, and the stride table with it. **That is
  also the best candidate for "you can't run"**: at `MORPH.tall` the hick is drawn 1.42x and his
  own `runRef` is 2.00, so a 7 m/s sprint clamped his walk cycle at `tsHi` and what was on screen
  was a body sliding with its legs barely moving.
  **WHAT I COULD NOT REPRODUCE BY READING IS THE ROTATION.** `rig.root.rotation.y` is written
  every frame from `player.faceH` with no morph gate anywhere near it, and `faceOff` measures ~0
  on every one of these rigs -- so *"the character doesn't rotate against the camera"* has no
  cause I can find in the code, and it is stated as unexplained rather than dressed up as fixed.
  What the borrow does is make the question moot: standing and turning he now has zap's idle, and
  moving he has the whole four-clip gait and both strafes.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin (draco wants a
  Worker) and there is no GPU, so **whether he stands up in the borrowed clips is a device
  question** -- the arithmetic that CAN be checked here is above and was. The chip carries
  `DNA HICK SKINNY+54` (how many of zap's clips he is actually wearing) or `NOBORROW`, because
  "the borrow refused", "it ran and the pose is wrong" and "it never transformed" are three bugs
  and one picture from a phone. `mel.MORPH.borrow = 0` is m112..m118 exactly, live.
- **THE BODY WAS HIDDEN BEFORE THE BLOB WAS THERE, AND THE COMMENT ABOVE IT CLAIMED THE
  OPPOSITE (m118, `MORPH.hide`, `MORPH.fade`, `MORPH.swell0`).** *"The character disappears
  before the blob shows up -- you shoot him, the character just disappears, then the blob shows
  up, then the new character's in its place. The blob needs to subsume and consume the character
  before the mesh disappears. Does that make sense? And same thing on the other end."*
  **HIS READING IS THE ARITHMETIC EXACTLY, AND m113's OWN NOTE SAID IT WAS THE OTHER WAY ROUND.**
  That note (and the line in this file) called `hide` *"strictly INSIDE the blob's own full
  window"*. `fade` is [.30, .70] and `hide` was [.27, .73], so it is strictly OUTSIDE it at both
  ends -- computed off the shipped `smooth` over a 0.90 s transform:
      m113   the body went  **0.027 s BEFORE** the blob reached full weight
             and came back  **0.027 s AFTER** it had already begun to leave
      m118   full blob over a VISIBLE body   0.189 s going in, 0.171 s coming out
  **A behaviour asserted only in a comment is not a behaviour** -- fifth time in this account,
  after `blast0`, the 40 cm cube, `CLIPS.block` and `packOff`, and the tell is the same every
  time: the sentence is in the imperative and the line under it is doing something else. The
  old line is left in place with the correction on it rather than quietly edited, because the
  claim is what made this cost five builds.
  **AND `hide` MUST SPAN THE SWAP, WHICH IS NOT THE MIDDLE.** The swap lands at
  `(out + hold) / tot` = **.622**, so the window is skewed late by construction and must not be
  made symmetric -- [.32, .72] leaves 0.088 s after the swap before the new body is drawn.
  Widening `hide` is therefore not free at the top end and `fade[1]` is what has to move.
  **AND THE SHELL INFLATES OVER HIM (`MORPH.swell0`).** A weight ramp alone is a thing fading up
  in FRONT of a body; *"subsume and consume"* is a thing CLOSING over one. It rides `w`, so it
  cannot disagree with the fade, needs no window of its own, and is symmetric for free -- the
  far end is the blob shrinking onto the new body and being absorbed rather than switched off.
  `.94 -> 1.16`, and `pad` .035 means it encloses at every radius a body actually has even at
  the bottom of that range, so it can never end up inside him and occluded by his own depth.
- **AND A LOW-POLY LUMP IS NOT A SWIRL (m118, `MORPH.flow`, the resolution, `SPK.n`).** *"We
  just need to add more detail to the blob. It's just kind of like not a very particle or
  swirling blob, it's just very like low poly mesh."* Three separate things, and the first is
  the one that actually answers the word he used:
  **THE SURFACE FLOWS.** Two counter-winding helices -- three ribbons up one way and five down
  the other, interfering into a moving lattice -- for one `sin`/`cos` pair a fragment. A static
  surface with a rim and some contour lines on it is a mesh whatever its triangle count; what
  makes it a SWIRL is that what is on it moves.
  **AND IT IS WRITTEN AS `cos(k*theta - phase)` EXPANDED IN (cos, sin), NEVER FROM AN `atan`.**
  An angle has a seam at +/-pi and the ONE quad that straddles it interpolates the whole way
  back round: a bright band welded to the blob for ever, in one place, which is exactly the
  class of fault nothing in this container can see. A DIRECTION vector has no seam, and the
  Chebyshev form of cos(3t)/sin(3t) in its components is continuous by construction -- which is
  also why the harmonics have to be INTEGERS. Checked numerically rather than argued: the
  identity holds to 2.6e-15 over the whole circle and to 5.6e-16 across the seam quad itself.
  **AND ITS CLOCK IS RESET PER TRANSFORM.** `MPH.t` only ever grew, and a phase in the thousands
  is where a fragment float stops resolving one frame from the next -- a moving pattern that
  quietly stops moving after an hour of play. A transform is under a second.
  **THE MESH IS 30 x 36 RATHER THAN 20 x 24**, 2160 triangles in the same one draw call, because
  24 facets round a torso read as facets. **And `lines` is PINNED at 20** rather than tracking
  `rings`: how many contour rings there are is a LOOK and how many rows the hull has is a
  RESOLUTION, and moving both at once means neither can be judged.
  **AND `mphProf`'s PASS COUNTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE GRID, NOT TYPED.** A fill pass reaches one
  CELL, so at 36 segments four of them cover two thirds of the arc they used to and the gap
  between the legs stops closing -- a spike of nothing exactly where the silhouette matters.
  Derived rather than given its own constant, **because `npm run hull` lifts that text and reads
  `MORPH` by name**: a key it does not know about arrives `undefined`, the loop runs zero times,
  and the gate reports a broken profile on a profile that is fine.
  **AND `mphFill` TOOK THE SWELL AS AN OPTIONAL EIGHTH ARGUMENT** for the same reason -- hull
  calls it with seven and measures the SHAPE rather than the ramp, so it defaults to
  `MORPH.swell` and that harness is unchanged.
  **THE SWARM IS ROUGHLY TWICE AS DENSE AND THE MOTES ARE SMALLER**, because "particle" reads as
  many small things rather than few big ones: `every`/`rushEvery` .012/.010 -> .0055, `spkSize`
  .10 -> .075, `blowN` 26 -> 44. At m115's rates about 92 were alive round him at once, which is
  a drift; at these it is nearer 190, so `SPK.n` went 360 -> 560 -- a pool that recycles out
  from under every other effect on screen during a one-second transform is worse than a bigger
  buffer, and a `Points` buffer is nothing.
  **AND THE MOTES GET A SIGNED RADIAL DRIFT, WHICH IS NOT THE SPIN'S RULE.** One sign of SPIN is
  what makes a swirl rather than a scramble (m115) and it stands; mixed signs on the RADIUS are
  a different axis -- some motes closing while others open is the cloud CHURNING, where one sign
  there would be a shell breathing in and out together.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** there is no GPU in this container and nothing here can build a
  skin, so **whether any of it looks better is a device question** -- that is stated rather than
  dressed up, and it is the same gap m115 ended on. What CAN be checked here is arithmetic and
  was: the two windows, the swap falling inside `hide`, and the seam. `npm run hull` is the one
  tool that covers the higher-resolution profile and it was NOT run. `mel.MORPH.flow = 0` is the
  m115 shader exactly, and `swell0`, `fade`, `hide`, `rings`, `seg` and every rate are live.
- **THE WARRIOR WAS SQUARED UP THE WHOLE TIME AND THE REFERENCE BEARING WAS WRONG (m117,
  `npm run sim` case 14).** *"yeah run it"* -- and it came back `1 FAILED`, on a row that has
  been red since **m112** with nobody looking. Not a regression from m116: bisected across five
  commits, and the DNA gun is where it turns.
  **IT IS THE THIRD INVENTED PASS MARK IN THIS ONE CASE, AND THE COMMENT ABOVE IT ALREADY
  RECORDS THE OTHER TWO.** The facing was `|wrap(d.h - PI)|` -- his heading against a HARD-CODED
  pi, which is the bearing to the player only while he stands on the +Z axis he spawned on. He
  CIRCLES (m36), so he does not. m112 shifted the seeded stream, he drew a different `nerve`,
  ended the fight at **(0.24, 0.21)** rather than dead ahead, and a correct fight failed for a
  third distinct reason. Measured honestly against the bearing to the player:
      at the closest frame   pos (-0.25, -0.22)   h 49 deg   bearing to player 49 deg
      TRUE min off-bearing   **0.0 deg**  -- he was squared up, and the REFERENCE was wrong
  **A MINIMUM OVER A WINDOW DOES NOT RESCUE A WRONG REFERENCE**, which is what m40's fix here
  stopped at: it made the SAMPLING honest and left the thing being compared against alone.
  **AND THE BEARING IS NOT SAMPLED ON TOP OF THE PLAYER.** He reaches 0.00 m in this harness --
  the player is never stepped, so `pushBodies` (which moves the PLAYER, not the body) never runs
  and nothing shoves him off -- and at zero gap the reference is `atan2(0, 0)`, which is noise.
  `copFly`'s rule one system over: a direction recovered from geometry where the two things
  coincide is not a direction. Sampled from `axis` .25 m out.
  **VERIFIED BY BREAKING THE RULE IN A COPY**, which is the only thing that proves an assertion
  is an assertion: bend the approach's `faceTo` by 1.2 rad and the row reads **75 deg off** and
  fails. The fixed version is a gate, not a row that cannot go red.
  **AND THE 0.00 m IS A STATED GAP RATHER THAN A FAULT.** This case pins the player on purpose so
  the warrior's approach is measured against a fixed point, which is right for testing a BRAIN --
  in the game he stops around `hold` 1.7 m. The row asserts `< hitR` 1.9 and passes honestly
  either way.

- **HE TELEPORTED OFF YOUR BACK, AND THE NOTE ABOVE THE LINE CLAIMED HE DID NOT (m116,
  `packOff`).** *"When you tell him to go back to roam he just like teleports down to the ground.
  I want him to literally jump off your backpack."* Exactly what it did. `packOff` set
  `st = 'idle'` -- and `idle` is the BRAIN: `foeWander` ends in `foeMove`, which SNAPS `P.y` to
  the ground on the very next frame. So he was on your back and then he was standing on the
  road, in one frame, with no flight in between.
  **AND THE COMMENT SAID "A DROP, NOT A TELEPORT."** Fourth time in this account that a comment
  has described an intent the code does not have (after `blast0`, the 40 cm cube and `CLIPS.block`)
  -- and the tell each time is the same: the sentence is in the imperative and the line under it
  is doing something else. **A behaviour asserted only in a comment is not a behaviour.**
  **THE MACHINERY WAS ALREADY THERE AND IT IS THE HOP.** `'hop'` owns nothing but a velocity and
  hands the whole arc to `bodyFly`, so the fall, the wall bounce, the ground stop and the landing
  thump come with it; it sits ABOVE `foeWander` so nothing snaps him down; and it holds
  `clips.air` (`falling_idle`, which he has) while he is off the ground and lets go the moment he
  is not. What this adds is a velocity and the arithmetic to choose it.
  **THE APEX IS THE NUMBER AND `vy` FALLS OUT OF IT**, m21/m74's rule: `offApex` is how far he
  rises ABOVE the seat, so leaving is a PUSH off your back rather than a step off a kerb. The
  flight time is then solved for the whole arc down to the real ground under him -- not typed,
  because how high the seat is depends on how tall YOU are and what is under you can be a box
  top -- and the travel falls out of that, so he lands `offGap` away however high he started.
  `leapDrag` 0 on his table is what keeps that exact.
  **AND `hopT` IS LEFT ALONE.** That is the STUCK-hop's cooldown and this is not one of those;
  clearing it would let a body that jumped off also hop on the next frame it snagged.
  **THE SEAT IS STILL A GUESS AND THE EXPORT IS STILL THE ANSWER.** *"I should probably put a
  joint in for where he goes -- I wanted him to be kind of hanging onto your backpack."* m105
  wired exactly that and it needs no code change on the day it lands: name a joint matching
  `PACK.mark` in the PLAYER's skin and it IS the seat, with no offset applied at all (`_exact`).
  Until then `seat.up` came .30 -> .22 and `back` .17 -> .21, which is lower and further onto
  his back -- a nudge to a number nothing in the file can measure, and said as one.

- **A SMOOTH GLOWING LUMP IS THE THING THAT READS AS NOTHING (m115).** *"I still would just love
  like a better particle effect. It just doesn't look that great -- I just wanna do a few passes
  to make the transition look way cooler."* m113 and m114 were both about the SHAPE being right,
  and the shape being right is not the same as the effect being good. What it had was one colour,
  one smooth surface, one population of particles all doing the same thing, and **no moment in
  it** -- a continuous ramp from nothing to nothing.
  **THE BEAM IS THE BIGGEST SINGLE THING.** One pass up the body across the whole effect, with a
  DIFFERENT COLOUR behind it from in front -- deep violet ahead, green behind -- so the shot
  literally travels across him turning one man into the other. It is the same `u` the wrap runs
  on, so the beam and the shape change are one event rather than two.
  **AND THE CONTOUR RINGS SAY WHAT THE THING IS MADE OF.** Thin bright rings at the hull's OWN
  slice spacing (`uLines` takes `MORPH.rings`), so it reads as something constructed out of
  measurements rather than as a blob. That is the honest picture as well as the better one.
  **THREE SPARK POPULATIONS, BECAUSE ONE IS A DRIFT.** Motes hang about him throughout, STREAKS
  rush IN over the first half, EMBERS blow OUT at the swap -- and the only new idea underneath
  all three is **`rv`, a rate on a follower's own radius**. `spark.rad` had been computed and
  never read since m39; a radius that can close is what turns an orbit into a GATHER, which is
  the one thing a transformation effect cannot do without. **`rv` defaults to 0, so every caller
  before this one is byte-for-byte the orbit it always had**, and it stays one pool and one
  draw call.
  **IT CONVERGES ON A FLOOR RATHER THAN THROUGH ZERO**, or a spark rushing in turns round and
  comes back out the far side, which reads as a bug and not as a gather.
  **AND THE RUSH IS THE FIRST HALF ONLY.** Past the swap there is nothing left to gather, and
  streaks still closing on a body that has already changed read as the effect running on.
  **THE SWAP IS THE ONE BEAT IN HERE, SO IT IS WHERE ALL THE PUNCTUATION GOES** -- the sound, a
  lens knock (`camShake`, m99's), a shockwave ring on the floor, the embers and the old burst,
  four things on one frame. **A ground ring is what gives an event a place and a size**, and it
  is its OWN mesh rather than `markRing`, which belongs to the guard lock: one owner per object.
  **AND IT OUTLIVES THE TRANSFORM**, so it is stepped from the frame loop rather than from
  `stepMorph`, which has returned by then.
  `SPK.n` went 260 -> 360, because three populations over 0.9 s would otherwise recycle the
  pool out from under every other effect on screen.
  **WHAT IS STILL UNVERIFIED IS EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS HERE**, and it is worth saying plainly:
  there is no GPU in this container, so no tool in this repo can say whether any of it looks
  good. `npm run hull` says the SHAPE is a body; nothing says the picture is worth watching.
  **THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT A WORKER** (see m114) -- it is a headless Chromium, which is
  installed here and which has a Worker of its own, so draco and the whole game just run. That
  is the thing to build the next time a look has to be judged more than once.

- **A LATHE IS A BODY OF REVOLUTION AND A PERSON IS NOT (m114, `npm run hull`).** *"It's sort of
  just like random, it doesn't look great. We could probably fake it better."* He is right and
  the cause is structural rather than a matter of taste: m113 measured ONE radius per height
  band, so a shoulder became a BARREL and both ends of the wrap were a lumpy pillar rather than
  the two people. **A body of revolution pins the widest sector of a row to its narrowest at
  exactly 1.00, by construction** -- which is a number, and it is the one the tool now prints.
  **THE SAME MEASUREMENT PASS GIVES A 2D FIELD FOR NOTHING.** Bucket by ANGLE as well as height
  and what comes out is a star-shaped hull -- arms out to the sides are two spikes at +/-90
  rather than a drum. Measured through the shipped `mphProf` over a synthetic body:
      ARM ROW   widest sector at **270 deg**, where the arms are, ratio **3.81**
      LEG ROW   ratio 1.99 -- two legs and the air between them, not a post
      the lathe 1.00 at every row, and the widest sector wherever the loop happened to start
  **AND THE RAW MAX IS ONE STRAY VERTEX PER SECTOR** -- an antenna, a fingertip, a hair chain --
  so the field is hole-filled from whatever neighbours have geometry and then smoothed, wrapping
  in angle and clamped in height. A hull built off raw maxima is spiky in exactly the way that
  reads as noise rather than as a body, which was the other half of "random".
  **THE WOBBLE WAS THE REST OF IT.** .17 at about 1 Hz on an 18-row lathe is a boil, and a boil
  on a shape whose whole job is to be recognisable IS the word he used. .07, and low frequency
  in both axes, so it breathes.
  **AND IT HAS TO BE TURNED WITH HIM NOW**, which a lathe never did: an arm is at an ANGLE, so
  the profile is measured with the skin's own `faceOff` baked in (one canonical frame for every
  body) and the blob carries `drawnYaw - faceOff`.
  **THE NORMAL COMES OFF THE GRID** -- the two tangents along the row and the column, crossed --
  rather than the lathe's closed form. The material is double sided and the rim reads `abs(dot)`,
  so which way round it comes out cannot show; what WOULD show is the zero at the poles, where
  the row tangent is nothing, and that is the one case guarded.
  **`npm run hull` IS THE GATE AND IT NEEDS NO ASSET AND NO GPU, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.**
  Every character GLB is draco and `DRACOLoader` decodes on a Worker built from a Blob URL,
  which node has not got -- **but the question here is not about the export.** It is whether the
  measurement, the hole fill, the smoothing and the wrap turn a cloud of vertices into a
  recognisable silhouette, and a SYNTHETIC body answers that exactly and in 80 ms. It lifts the
  shipped text between the `PROF:` markers and reads `MORPH` out of `index.html`, because a tool
  with its own copy of the rule is this account's oldest mistake.
  **VERIFIED BY PUTTING THE LATHE BACK IN A COPY** -- `widest at 0 deg, ratio 1.00`, three rows
  red -- which is the only thing that proves a gate is a gate.
  **AND NO, A WORKER IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THE DECODE EITHER.** Shredworld already solved it a
  better way: decompress the GLB ONCE offline with gltf-transform and serve the plain copy in
  its place -- same geometry, same names, same graph, and no Worker to fake. Worth doing the day
  a measurement on the REAL mesh would settle something; it would not have settled this, and it
  cannot settle how anything looks, because there is no GPU here either.

- **TWO SKINS HAVE NO CORRESPONDENCE TO INTERPOLATE, BUT THEIR SILHOUETTES DO (m113, `mphProf`,

  `mphMesh`, `mphFill`, `mphBlob`).** *"Some sort of blob that makes the transition look like the
  collider actually transforming to each other -- a proxy mesh that morphs and wraps from one mesh
  to the other, and some weird kind of particle effect swirling and glowing around it. Not super
  long, but something so it's not just like a jump."*
  **A REAL VERTEX MORPH IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE AND NEVER WILL BE**, which is the whole reason m112
  was a model SWAP: two characters share no topology, no vertex count and no skeleton, so there is
  no pair of vertices to lerp between. **What every body DOES have, and has the same number of, is
  a RADIUS PER HEIGHT BAND** -- so the blob is a hull of `rings` x `seg` cells whose radii travel from one
  body's field to the other's, and at its two ends it genuinely IS the two shapes.
  **AND THE PROFILE IS MEASURED OFF THE MESH, NOT AUTHORED.** GLTFLoader binds every skin with the
  IDENTITY matrix, so at rest a skinned vertex's GEOMETRY position is its position in the model's
  own space -- the same fact `measureHeight` is built on, and what makes a silhouette readable at
  runtime with no tool and nothing typed. Once per kind, cached on the skin beside its clips, and
  a re-export at any size lands right because the model's own scale is what it is multiplied by.
  **THE BODY IS NOT DRAWN WHILE THE BLOB HAS IT (`MORPH.hide`), AND THAT IS THE FIX.** m112 drew
  one body and then the other with a white flash over the seam -- and **a flash over a cut is
  still a cut**, which is his sentence exactly. Hidden through the middle, the only thing on
  screen at the swap is a shape travelling from one silhouette to the other.
  **`visible = false` RATHER THAN A FADE**, because a transparent skin sorts against itself (m30,
  m31) and because it costs nothing: no program recompile, no sorting, no second path. It is set
  in ONE place and restored in one (`mphBlobOff`, plus the outgoing model at the swap) -- **a skin
  left invisible is a skin that is invisible the next time it is worn**, and every exit goes
  through there.
  **ONE `u` ACROSS THE WHOLE THING, so the blob runs continuously THROUGH the swap** rather than
  restarting at it. The phases still own the white tint; `u` owns everything drawn, and the
  windows are its own fractions rather than being tied to a phase boundary:
      fade .30-.70   the blob at full weight, ramped either side
      hide .27-.73   the body not drawn -- **and this line CLAIMED it was strictly inside the
                     blob's own full window and it was the exact inverse. See m118.**
      wrap .14-.86   the silhouette travelling, so it is settled on the right shape at both ends
      the swap lands at u .62, by which point the blob is 74% of the way to the new body
  **A FRESNEL RIM IS WHAT MAKES A SILHOUETTE READ AS A VOLUME.** Flat, an additive lathe is a
  green cut-out of a man; hot at the grazing angle it has an inside. 21 rows x 24 segments is 504
  vertices and 960 triangles, rebuilt each frame, in **one draw call**.
  **THE SWIRL IS THE EXISTING SPARK POOL**, one more draw call and no second system: m39's
  `follow` so the sparks ride him rather than being left behind, and **ONE SIGN of spin, because
  a random sign per spark is a scramble and not a swirl.** `spk` gained an optional 11th argument
  for that; absent, it is the random tumble every impact has always had, so no caller moved.
  **AND THEY ARE EMITTED AROUND `rig.root`, NOT AROUND `player.pos`.** `spk` stores the offset
  against the root it is handed, and `stepMorph` runs BEFORE `rig.root.position.copy(player.pos)`
  -- so taking the centre from the root is what makes the offset exactly the one intended, and
  `stepSparks` then draws them at the current position with no lag at all.
  **THE RATE RIDES THE WEIGHT**, so the swirl thickens into the wrap and thins out of it -- the
  jetpack's own rule (`JET.every`), that a run of particles coming faster is a machine winding up.
  **AND THE TIMING BARELY MOVED, because he said "not super long".** .42/.10/.40 -> .34/.22/.34,
  which is 0.92 s to **0.90 s** -- what changed is that the middle is now long enough for a wrap
  to happen in rather than being a seam.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** every character GLB is draco and `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker,
  so **nothing in this container can build a skin** -- the profile has never been measured off a
  real mesh outside a browser, and whether the blob reads as a morph, whether `swell` 1.18 plainly
  encloses him, and whether the boil reads as weird or as broken are device questions. The gates
  cover the throw class and nothing else here can. `mel.MORPH.blob = 0` is the one word back to
  m112, and `swell` / `pad` / `wob` / `rim` / `fade` / `hide` / `wrap` / `spin` / `every` are
  all live.
- **THE DNA GUN, AND THE TRANSFORM IS A MODEL SWAP INSIDE `rig.root` (m112, `MORPH`, `morphGo`,
  `mphWear`, `morphAnim`).** *"The alien has some sort of DNA gun -- you shoot one of the NPCs and
  the character transforms into them. How about we do a third gun mode which is the DNA thing. We
  don't have all of the animations for the player that we do for the NPCs, so if you transform
  into them you could only do basic locomotion, you wouldn't be holding a gun any more -- but
  since those characters have walk and idle and run we could just try it. My original thought was
  sculpting a single base mesh around every character so it's a literal mesh transform, but we
  could just cheat it: the character mesh glows and turns white, then you blend them, and it turns
  from white to the new character's colour. Just as a test, and then a little button to transform
  back."*
  **NEARLY ALL OF IT WAS ALREADY BUILT, AND THAT IS `d.K`'S DIVIDEND FOR THE NINTH TIME.** `rig`
  is the player's DRAWN BODY and nothing more -- a model, a mixer, an action table, a clip table,
  a damped weight table, a bone map, a facing offset and a mount map. Every one of those is a
  FIELD, so wearing somebody else is repointing them at a clone of that kind's proto and putting
  his own set aside in `rig.base`. **`stepPlayer`, the collider, the camera, the heading, the
  bolts and the whole of the physics never learn it happened.** The kinds already carry a measured
  proto; `bodyProto` stashing it on `K.P` is the one line that made it reachable, and a proto that
  exists only as a local inside a builder is a proto nothing else can reach.
  **AND THE THIRD MODE IS WHAT m52 SAID IT WOULD BE.** *"A third mode is a row in that table and
  the arc simply divides three ways."* One row in `WEAP.modes`, one `dnaNow()` beside `autoNow()`,
  and the arc row, the lit segment, the hint and the hysteresis all came with it.
  **THE SAMPLE ROUND IS NOT A WEAPON, WHICH IS WHY IT BRANCHES RATHER THAN TAKING A FLAG.** It
  never goes through `dummyHit` at all: no cone, no power, no damage, no blast, no knock-down, no
  `d.cool`. `dnaCatch` is the nearest body it can actually be WORN as, and nothing else in the
  game reads it -- threading a "this one does nothing" flag through six arguments of the weapon
  path would be one function pretending to be two.
  **WHO CAN BE SAMPLED IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A LIST.** A body you can wear has to stand, walk and run,
  because those three ARE the morphed gait -- so `dnaOK` is `K.clips.idle && walk && run` and the
  officer (an idle and nothing else) is refused by what he IS rather than by name. `stripPoses`'
  own rule, one table over. Everybody else on the street qualifies.
  **HE IS DRAWN AT THE KIND'S OWN HEIGHT, AND THE GAIT REFERENCES ARE THE ARGUMENT.** A disguise
  that stands a head shorter than the men it is a disguise for is not one -- and `K.walkRef` /
  `K.runRef` are how fast the planted foot slides AT THAT KIND'S OWN SCALE (m52), so drawing him
  at `K.h` is what lets the clips be played at their own numbers with nothing re-derived.
  **THE COLLIDER DOES NOT FOLLOW**: `p.r`, `p.hh`, `MOVE.step` and every speed stay his, because
  changing a body's size mid-game is m52's whole build and this is a test. **One term does have
  to follow, and it is the camera's look point** -- `CAM.look` is chest height on HIM, which on a
  1.78 m drunk is the man's waist and frames him low. `MORPH.tall = 0` draws him at his own height
  for the A/B.
  **AND THE GAIT IS THE HONEST LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** `K.runRef` on a drunk is 1.8 to
  2.0 m/s and the player sprints at 7.2, so past a run the clip clamps at that kind's own `tsHi`
  and the feet slide. That is *"you could only do like basic locomotion"* said as a number. The
  fix is a faster clip or a slower disguise and neither is this build.
  **THE FLASH IS AN EMISSIVE RAMP AND THE SWAP HAPPENS AT THE TOP OF IT**, which is his cheat
  exactly: the body you are TAKING OFF goes white, the mesh is exchanged while nothing is
  readable, and the new one comes up out of the white. Both halves matter -- whiten only the
  arrival and what you see is one body vanishing and another appearing.
  **A 1x1 WHITE TEXTURE RATHER THAN `emissiveMap = null`.** `USE_EMISSIVEMAP` is a #define, so
  swapping a map for NOTHING is a program compile and link in the middle of the one second the
  effect is on screen; texture to texture is not. Every material's own colour, emissive, map and
  intensity are stashed on it the first time it is tinted and put back exactly, so a body that has
  been worn is byte-for-byte what it was afterwards -- which is what lets it be worn again.
  **AND THE WORN SKIN'S MATERIALS ARE ITS OWN.** `skeletonClone` SHARES them, so without the clone
  the flash would whiten every copy of that kind standing in the street -- m39's `bodyFlash`
  lesson, one body over.
  **THE SKIN IS BUILT WHEN THE SHOT LANDS AND KEPT ON THE KIND.** A transform that clones a mesh,
  a skeleton and a mixer on the frame it fires is a hitch on exactly the frame something is
  happening, and wearing the same man twice is the common case.
  **AND THE SWAP SEEDS THE NEW SKIN AT ITS IDLE.** `skinWeights` damps in over `.055`, so a fresh
  `cw` leaves every bone at a total weight of nothing for a frame or two -- which is the mixer
  blending back to BIND, **which is the T-pose exactly**. It is masked by the white, and a flash
  of T-pose is not a thing to leave to luck.
  **`stepMorph` RUNS ABOVE `rigAnim` FOR THE SAME REASON.** Run after it, the frame's weights are
  set on the body that has just been taken off and the new one spends a frame at zero.
  **AND `rigAnim` NEEDED ONE EARLY RETURN, NOT A BRANCH PER STATE.** Every clip name below that
  line is zap's, and a table naming none of the actions a borrowed skin has takes `skinWeights`'
  own T-pose escape hatch **and lands in the thing it exists to prevent** -- because the fallback
  is `CLIPS.idle`, which this skin has never heard of either. `morphAnim` builds its table out of
  the KIND's clips and passes the KIND's idle as the fallback, which closes that hole completely.
  **THE VERBS ARE OFF BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CLIPS FOR THEM, NOT BECAUSE THE STATES WOULD BREAK.**
  A strike, a roll, a dash, a slam, a backflip, wall cover and a ledge hang all end in a pose a
  borrowed skin has not got, which is a body sliding about in its walk cycle. `mphOn()` is the one
  predicate all of them read, and `stepKit` is a single early return that CLEARS rather than skips
  -- a thumb that was on the pad when the shot landed must not arrive still armed.
  **AND HE LETS GO OF THE WALL**, through `wallDrop`/`ledgeDrop` rather than by clearing the
  fields, because those two states have their own exits and a pinned man in a walk pose is the one
  thing this cannot leave behind.
  **THE FOOTSTEPS FOLLOW THE BODY.** `STEP.clip` is `{ d, r }` per band (m68), so the morph carries
  its own measured pair and `strideNow` works the distance out at the speed he is going -- without
  it the feet are a drunk's and the sound is zap's stride.
  **AND THE SEAT BONE IS INVALIDATED.** `PACK._b` is looked up once and cached, which is right and
  is exactly what a swapped model breaks -- a stale one is Clancy riding a bone that is no longer
  in the scene.
  **THE WAY BACK IS A GESTURE THAT ALREADY EXISTS.** *"A little button to transform back."* The
  left pad's tap is already "change what you are carrying", the kit is forced to bare hands for the
  whole disguise, so there is nothing to cycle to -- and the weapon label says `tap left pad ·
  revert`, which is the prompt drawn on the control that performs it. `actB`'s rule, and it is what
  stops a re-used gesture being a hidden mode.
  **AND THE `zap` SAMPLE IS FINALLY THE SOUND OF THE THING IT IS A RECORDING OF.** m27 took it off
  the blaster as a duplicate and it has been loaded and unused since; an electrical sample beam is
  what it always was.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** every character GLB here is draco and `DRACOLoader` wants a
  Worker, so **nothing in this container can build a skin** -- whether the white reads as a
  transform, whether a drunk's walk at 7 m/s reads as a slide or as a bug, and whether a 1.78 m
  body on a 1.25 m collider reads wrong are all device questions. The chip is what answers the
  first half of any report: `DNA HICK SKINNY` is who he is wearing and `DNAOUT0.21` is the flash
  running, because "the shot did nothing", "it fired and he never changed" and "he changed into the
  wrong one" are three bugs and one picture from a phone. `mel.dna('hobo')` wears the nearest
  matching kind with no shot fired, `mel.dna()` puts him back, and `mel.MORPH` is live.
  **NOT DONE, AND EACH FOR A REASON:** nobody REACTS to the disguise -- *"when the game is fully
  built you're in a human city and you're an alien, so if people see you they get afraid of you,
  if cops see you they shoot at you, but if you transform into one of them they don't think
  anything of it"* -- and that is `foeTarget`'s own aggro rule rather than a rider on this. There
  is no sample-and-return, no DNA the gun HOLDS and no menu of what you have collected; the shot
  transforms you on the spot, which is his *"we don't need to get so detailed with that whole
  thing"*. And the literal mesh transform wants the one base mesh he described, which is an ASSET
  decision: the moment every character shares a topology, this same swap becomes a morph-target
  blend with `mphWear` doing the same job.
- **THE SWAP IS TWO EVENTS NOW, AND BOTH CROSSINGS ARE MEASURED (m111, `SWAP.hide`/`SWAP.show`).**
  *"The weapon switches before he looks like the first weapon goes into the backpack -- his arm
  reaches into the backpack and then comes back to rest out of it. The weapon needs to switch like
  halfway through, or the first one needs to go away when he goes into the backpack and the second
  one needs to come."*
  **HIS SECOND SENTENCE IS THE BETTER DESIGN AND IT IS WHAT SHIPPED.** "Switch halfway" is ONE
  event -- a weapon visibly turning into another weapon, at a better moment. Two crossings mean
  **you never see a weapon change at all**: one goes away behind his back, his hands are empty in
  the bag, and a different one comes out. m91 wrote `SWAP.at` as a single fraction and said out
  loud that **.48 was a guess** (*"a strike has an authored contact frame to measure against and a
  reach does not"*); this is that guess replaced by a measurement, and the fraction was never the
  thing that was wrong.
  **THE BAG IS WHERE THE MOUNT GOES BEHIND HIM, AND THAT IS READABLE OFF THE SAMPLERS.** Forward
  kinematics over `weapon_swap`'s real tracks, reading `weapon_root_right` in the HIPS' frame --
  animation samplers are never draco compressed, so the clip is measurable here even though the
  mesh is not:
      u .00 .. .31   the hand swings up and FORWARD, mount z +5 -> +17
      u .313         it crosses BEHIND the plane of his hips          <- `hide`
      u .508         deepest, z -12.5 -- the hand is over his shoulder, in the bag
      u .576         it comes back out in front                       <- `show`
      u .58 .. 1.0   presented out in front at z +24, then down to rest
  **AND `.48` WAS ALREADY INSIDE THAT WINDOW**, at 0.408 s of a 0.85 s state -- which is why
  *"almost immediately"* could not be reproduced by reading the code, and that is stated rather
  than dressed up as a found bug. What a single event at mid-reach looks like is the weapon
  changing in a fist that is out of sight, so the NEXT thing you see is the new one already in
  hand; the first one never visibly went anywhere. Two crossings are what fixes that whether or
  not the old number was late.
  **REVERSED, THE CROSSINGS MIRROR *AND EXCHANGE ROLES*.** A stow plays the clip backwards (m96),
  so the hand ENTERS the bag at `1 - show` and LEAVES it at `1 - hide`. Mirroring one and not the
  other, or mirroring both without swapping them, puts the hide AFTER the show -- which is a
  weapon that appears and then vanishes.
  **AND `swapStop` HAS TO CLEAR `p.swapHid` BEFORE `applySlot`, OR A CANCELLED SWAP STRANDS HIM
  EMPTY-HANDED FOR EVER.** Five things cancel a reach (`meleeGo`, `rollGo`, `slamGo`, `wallGo`, the
  knock-down) and every one of them still DELIVERS the slot -- m91's own rule, that an input given
  must not be lost to a collision -- so the one new way to get it wrong is to deliver a slot whose
  model is still hidden. `paintKit` reads the flag, so clearing it first is the whole fix.
  **THE HANDS-EMPTY WINDOW IS 0.223 s AT `dur` .85**, about six frames at 30 fps. That is the dial
  if two events still read as one: widening it means lengthening `dur`, which is the beat of the
  whole reach and is deliberately NOT moved here, so this build changes one variable.
  `mel.SWAP.hide = 0; mel.SWAP.show = .48` is m110 exactly.
- **THE STREETS ARE THE LAYOUT, AND THEY ARE PAINT (m110, `STREET`, `buildStreets`).** *"Yes I
  think you should try to build some procedural streets, I'll make some more buildings and we
  can populate it."* What he needs first is the ARMATURE -- where a road runs and where a
  building can stand -- so the whole generator is two lists of centrelines and one rule.
  **A PLOT IS A ROAD GRID'S ONLY REAL OBJECT.** The slab drawn for each plot is the plot
  INFLATED by the pavement, so the carriageway is simply the gap between slabs: a junction
  needs no case of its own and the corners fall out of the arithmetic rather than being built.
  Four merged meshes, **4 draw calls and 520 triangles for the whole city**, whatever the grid
  grows to.
  **THE TEST SITE IS THE PLAZA.** `skip` leaves one plot unpainted, and the white floor, both
  grid helpers, the fourteen boxes, the ledge stack, the motorcycle ring and every body spawn
  are inside it, untouched. It gets a 2.5 m RIM rather than a slab, so the four roads round it
  have a kerb to stop against and nothing underneath is buried.
  **AND IT IS FLAT ON PURPOSE -- A RAISED KERB WOULD EAT EVERY CHARGED SHOT.** The obvious
  build is a 15 cm pavement pushed into `BOXES`, and `BOXES` is not only the collider: the BOLT
  dies on it too, through `camHit(b.pos.x, b.pos.y, b.pos.z, WEAP.boltR)`. A full charge ball
  is 1.9 m across and leaves a muzzle under a metre up aimed at a point on the GROUND, so it is
  under `0.15 + boltR` for its whole flight -- **every charged shot fired over a pavement would
  detonate on the frame it left the barrel.** A kerb is not a wall, which is the same sentence
  `wallFind` and `ledgeFind` already say (*"a kerb is cover for nobody"*, *"a kerb is not a
  ledge"*), and `camHit` is the one place that has never been told. **Give it a minimum height
  and the relief -- kerbs, lamps, crossings -- becomes a build**; until then the street is a
  PICTURE, the collider is untouched, and nothing here had to be checked against nine other
  systems. That is also why there are no lamp posts: a post is either in `BOXES` (and stops
  bolts across the whole map, and offers wall cover behind an 18 cm pole) or it is not (and he
  walks through it), and both answers want the `camHit` change first.
  **CHECKED AS RECTANGLES, NEVER PLACED BY EYE** (m60's rule): every slab and all sixteen
  carriageway strips against the fourteen boxes, the building's plan, the tower's, the bike's
  ring and all nineteen body spawns plus the spawn point -- **0 overlaps, tightest clearance
  5.00 m** (the road at x=-52 against the motorcycle's ring). Plots come out 36 x 36 at the
  corners and 84 x 36 / 36 x 80 on the sides; his building is 20.9 m across, so the smallest
  plot holds one with 7.5 m of pavement either side.
  **THE Z-RUNNING ROADS RUN THE WHOLE LENGTH AND THE X-RUNNING ONES ARE CUT AT EACH JUNCTION.**
  Drawing both full length puts two quads at the same height on the same square metre at every
  crossing, which is a z-fight; cutting one family is a loop bound and nothing else. **And the
  four coats are 12 mm apart rather than 3**, because these are 36 m quads and a depth buffer a
  hundred metres out does not separate three millimetres.
  **`mel.streets(0)` takes the whole layout away and `mel.STREET` is live**, so where the grid
  sits is a thing to move on the phone rather than a thing to push.

- **AND HIS STREETS KIT CANNOT BE ASSEMBLED FROM THIS SIDE, WHICH IS A FACT ABOUT THE FILE AND
  NOT ABOUT THE IDEA (m110).** `models/streets/modular_streets_kit.glb` was read before a line
  was written: **321 nodes, 198,528 triangles, 2 materials, 2 images** (`modularkit`, a 1401 KB
  WebP; the second is 0 KB and belongs to a plain grey material used by exactly ONE primitive),
  draco + `EXT_texture_webp` + specular + ior, 0 skins, 0 animations, and both materials
  `doubleSided: true` -- which has to be forced to `FrontSide` the day anything loads it, the
  standing rule for every generated asset here.
  **IT IS A CATALOGUE, NOT A SCENE.** The one primitive on the grey material is `Rectangle001`,
  a 132 x 208 m flat plane -- a BACKDROP -- and 244 pieces are laid out on it in a regular
  field, 69% of a 190 x 210 m area occupied. In one corner (x -90..-32, z 125..175) sit 75
  pieces assembled into something, with geometry up to 20 m above the road plane.
  **AND EVERY HANDLE FOR TELLING ONE PIECE FROM ANOTHER IS MISSING:**
      names      all 321 are `modular kit00` .. `modular kit320`. Nothing semantic at all.
      UVs        `TEXCOORD_0` accessors carry no min/max (draco), so which patch of the atlas
                 a piece samples -- the one honest way to tell tarmac from brick -- is unreadable
      geometry   draco, and nothing in this container can decode a mesh
      shapes     263 DISTINCT footprints. The road-plane family is not a tile set: it is big
                 irregular slabs 7 to 26 m across in GRADED SERIES (0.18 x 6.03, 0.32 x 6.34,
                 0.48 x 6.63 ... 1.90 x 7.99), which is a swept curve discretised, not a grid
  So all I have per piece is an axis-aligned bounding box and a triangle count, and **a kerb, a
  bench, a wall and a road slab are the same box from here.** Any layout built on that is
  placing art by eye, which is the one thing this account's rules say over and over not to do.
  **WHAT WOULD MAKE IT USABLE, cheapest first:** name the pieces by kind in the export (`road_*`,
  `kerb_*`, `lamp_*` -- `weapFit`'s rule, a named thing IS the placement); or export the
  assembled corner on its own as one GLB, which drops in as a prop with nothing guessed; or
  export a handful of SQUARE tiles on one module size, which tiles with no classification at
  all. Until one of those, m110's grid is generated geometry and the kit is in `bump.mjs`'s
  `DIRS` waiting (**eighth time** that tax has been paid).

- **THE BIKE IN THE GROUND AND THE RIDER AT "PROPER HEIGHT" ARE ONE ARITHMETIC ERROR, TWICE
  (m109, `motoLow`, `stepRide`'s drop).** *"He rides the motorcycle but the motorcycle is in the
  ground. He has proper height but the motorcycle doesn't."*
  **BOTH HALVES ARE A ROOT BEING TREATED AS A FLOOR, AND EACH ONE HID THE OTHER.** Measured off
  the two files:
      the bike   its root is the AXLE, 0.138 authored above the lowest geometry -> **0.279 m**
                 scaled, and `stepMoto` put that root ON the ground -- so the tyres were buried
                 a quarter of a metre and **the seat, and therefore the rider, went down with
                 them**. That is exactly why a sunken bike read as a rider at the right height:
                 he was correctly seated on a seat that was underground.
      the rider  `driving_idle` sits his hips **0.373 m** above his own root (0.608 standing,
                 and all three driving clips agree to four decimals), and `stepRide` wrote the
                 ROOT to the seat -- so he stood in the air 37 cm over it.
  Together those nearly cancel in the PICTURE and not in the world, which is the whole reason
  the report named only one of them. **`buildShip`'s rule one vehicle over: sit a model on its
  own measured bounds, never on its node origin.** Seat 0.652 m above the ground now, his hips
  on it, his lowest foot at 0.381 -- a Fat Boy's peg is 0.30 to 0.38.
  **AND THE OFFSET IS READ OFF THE POSED SKELETON RATHER THAN TYPED.** It is a property of
  whichever driving clip is up, so it follows a re-export AND follows the blend -- and reading it
  a frame late is EXACT, because the offset is a fact about the POSE and does not move with the
  position it is measured against. **The bike's own marker is called `mixamorig_hips`**: he put a
  HIPS where the rider's hips go, so hips-to-hips is the export saying what to do rather than
  this code having an opinion, which is `weapFit`'s rule.
  **A BOUNDING BOX IS NOT A SHAPE, AND THAT IS WHY `motoLow` TAKES A HULL.** Upright the box's
  lowest corner IS the lowest vertex, so 0.279 is exact -- but rolled onto its side the lowest
  CORNER is empty air beside the wheel at bar width, and a bike resting on it hovers. The convex
  hull of the real (x, y) is a dozen points, exact at every roll, and computed once at load.
  So **upright and on its side are ONE formula** rather than two numbers to keep in step.
- **A RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE RIDES A LITTLE AND THEN FALLS OVER (m109, `MOTO.st`).** *"And the
  motorcycle drives without him even when I shoot him off. It should ride a little and then fall
  over."* It did: `stepMoto` drove the ring on its own clock and had never heard of the rider.
      ride -> coast -> fall -> down -> rise -> ride
  **THE WHOLE MACHINE TURNS ON ONE READ, AND IT IS READ OFF THE MAN.** `manned` is
  `rider.st === 'ride'`, and `dummyBlow` already takes him out of that state when he is shot --
  so being blasted off, knocked down, fleeing and coming back are ONE fact with nothing to keep
  in step and no flag for a future blow to forget to clear. `d.K`'s own dividend, one vehicle over.
  **AND IT COASTS ALONG THE RING, NOT OFF DOWN THE TANGENT.** That is not a detail: the m107
  circle is the only path here swept clear of fourteen boxes, two buildings and every body, so a
  bike that leaves it is a bike that can come to rest **inside** something -- the m24 lesson,
  where nothing on screen disagrees with anything and the player simply cannot walk there.
  **THE STEER ANGLE IS UNCHANGED BY THE COAST, WHICH IS THE ARITHMETIC AGREEING WITH ITSELF.**
  `delta = atan(L*w/v)` with `w = v/r` reduces to `atan(L/r)` -- independent of speed, which is
  what a fixed-radius corner actually demands. So the bars hold their 6.5 degrees as it slows,
  and the wheels alone wind down.
  **IT GOES OVER INTO THE CORNER IT WAS ALREADY LEANING INTO**, the sign READ off the lean rather
  than typed -- which is what a bike running out of speed mid-turn does -- and the topple is the
  SAME `roll` the lean is, so the height cannot disagree with the picture and an interrupted rise
  cannot jump.
- **AND HE GOES BACK FOR IT (m109, `motoSeek`).** *"Then he should go try to find it again."*
  It runs in the same line as `stepRide` and ABOVE the brain, `stepPack`'s own rule: a man walking
  back to his own bike has no roam, no fight and nothing to be separated from. **`d.ride` is what
  makes it HIS** -- set at build, survives being shot off -- so nothing has to be remembered
  anywhere else and no second body can take it.
  **AND `d.fleeT` IS WHY HE DOES NOT TURN ROUND MID-PANIC.** m38's pacifist runs when he is hit,
  so a biker blasted off his bike flees FIRST and collects it afterwards, which is the order that
  reads. One clause rather than a state.
  **THE PICK-UP IS A STAND-IN AND IS MARKED AS ONE.** *"I don't have him picking it up animation
  but I'll make one eventually."* So it rights itself over `riseDur` with him aboard from the
  first frame -- name a clip and `motoSeek`'s board branch is the one line it goes on, which is
  `CLIPS.block`'s pattern. Until then he sits upright while the hull rolls up under him for 0.9 s.
  **AND `buildMoto` CALLS `stepMoto(0)` BEFORE `buildBikers` EXISTS**, so on that one frame there
  is no rider and the coast would be entered from a standing start and never left. The clause
  that closes it -- a coasting bike with somebody on it drives again -- is also the real case of
  getting back onto a bike still rolling, which is why it is a transition rather than a guard.
  **THE CHIP CARRIES THE STATE** (`MOTO12` riding, else `MOTOcoast` / `fall` / `down` / `rise`),
  because *"it never fell over"*, *"it fell and he never went back for it"* and *"he got there and
  it did not come up"* are three bugs and one picture from a phone.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** the motorcycle is draco and nothing in this container can decode
  a mesh or build a skin, so the HULL has never been computed outside a browser -- what is checked
  here is that at roll 0 it provably equals the bounding-box minimum, which is the 0.279 m that
  answers his report. Whether 77 degrees reads as fallen, whether 0.9 s of self-righting reads as
  a man picking a bike up, and whether the coast is the right length are device questions.
  `mel.MOTO.on = 0` parks the whole thing and `mel.MOTO.st` is live.

- **I CLAIMED HIS `run_fwd` WAS AUTHORED BACKWARDS AND IT IS NOT (m108).** *"What are you
  talking about, I just checked the file, it looks normal."* He is right, and the fault is that
  **I asked a measurement a question it was never fitted to answer.**
  `npm run gait`'s `travel` column derives its bearing by SUMMING the raw per-frame displacement
  over every frame where the toe sits in the lower half of its range -- which on a run is the
  stance phase plus most of the swing, and the swing travels forward fast. **That is the exact
  net-displacement-over-low-frames measure a control had already killed one hour earlier**, on
  zap's own `run_fwd`, and I wrote that lesson down and then quoted a second tool doing the same
  arithmetic. The SPEED beside it is a median over frames within 60 degrees of that bearing and
  is sound; the speed is the only thing that column was fitted for.
  **AND "BOTH FEET AGREEING" WAS A MISREADING OF THE FLAG.** `spread` compares `per[0]` against
  `per[1]` -- the two feet's SPEEDS. The two DIRECTIONS are summed into a single bearing and
  never compared to each other, so there is no direction agreement check in that tool at all. I
  cited the absence of a flag as corroboration for the one thing the flag says nothing about.
  **THE TELL WAS IN THE SAME ROW I READ THE CLAIM OFF.** 5 and 6 stance frames of 18, against
  zap's 8/9 and the hick's 8/8 -- the fewest of any run clip in the repo, so the most float, so
  the least reliable sum. **A derived quantity with fewer samples behind it than every control
  is not a finding**, and the control that disagrees with it is the one to believe.
  So `run` and `flee` name `run_fwd` with its own measured reference (1.694 authored, **3.43 m/s**
  at his x2.026) and he runs at 2.8 and flees at 3.2 -- a little under the reference, because he
  is heavy, which puts the clip at ts .82 rather than scrambling it.
  **AND THE LESSON IS NOT "THAT TOOL IS BAD".** It is that a column fitted for one quantity can
  print a second one beside it that nothing ever validated -- `travel` was added at m35 to tell a
  strafe from a backpedal, where the stance phase dominates and it works. **Ask what a column was
  fitted to answer before quoting it about something else.**

- **AND THE FILES WERE IN THE REPO THE WHOLE TIME -- MY CLONE WAS STALE (m107).** `git log` showed
  only my own three commits and `ls models/` had no biker and no bike, which is m80's *"the file is
  somewhere else"* and m58's *"four of his five pushes never left his machine"* wearing one face.
  It was neither: `git fetch` brought down `e3d365c added fat biker 02` and `7dbd65a added vehicles
  folder and motorcycle`, both sitting on `origin/main`. **`git log` answers a question about the
  LOCAL clone**, and after a push of my own the local head is exactly as far behind as it was
  before. Fetch before concluding a file never arrived.

- **THE LEDGE HOP WAS THE ONE STATE THAT ENTERED A `ONCE` CLIP WITHOUT `playOnce` (m106).**
  *"When you're hanging on the side of a ledge and you push left or right it plays the side hop
  animation only once -- it doesn't do it for every movement. It needs to be segmented, so when
  you push over to the side he hops over to the side to match the animation, and it goes once,
  some distance over per animation."*
  **THE MECHANIC WAS ALREADY DISCRETE AND THE ANIMATION WAS NOT.** m102 built the shimmy as one
  hop per press on purpose (*"the shimmy is DISCRETE here, because the clips are HOPS"*), and
  the state machine really does fire a fresh hop on every frame the thumb is still held. What
  did not happen is the CLIP: both hops are in `ONCE` and **nothing in the file ever called
  `playOnce` for them** -- the weight table merely named one, and `skinWeights` rewinds an action
  only once its damped weight has decayed. So the first hop played, the second arrived with the
  action still PAUSED on its last frame, and he slid sideways holding that pose. **This file's
  oldest landmine, written down twice, in the one state that entered a one-shot without the
  function written for it** -- `wallGo` does it correctly one surface down, which is what makes
  this an omission rather than a design.
  **AND THE DURATION WAS TYPED WITH NO REFERENCE TO THE EXPORT.** Measured off the samplers:
      ledge_hang_hop_left   1.542 s   hips XZ **0.000** -- in place; the CODE drives the travel
      ledge_hang_hop_right  1.708 s   hips XZ  0.000     y range 21.5 / 23.5 armature units,
                                                         which is 0.30 m of real vertical arc:
                                                         he pulls up, moves, and drops back on
      ledge_hang_to_get_up_over_ledge  1.208 s   ledge_hang_to_jump_away 1.333 s
  `hopDur` .50 played those at **x3.08 and x3.42** -- a blur with no pose in it, and two
  DIFFERENT blurs, because one number cannot fit two clips. The duration is the clip's own over
  `hopRate`, which is **1.75 = `MELEE.rate`**: m95 fitted that to the band this file already
  judges a one-shot readable at, over clips of exactly this length. 0.88 s and 0.98 s.
  **AND THE DISTANCE GOES UP WITH THE TIME, or matching the clip just halves his traversal.**
  `hop` .85 -> 1.05 of `SZ` is 0.75 m, about six tenths of his own height -- *"a little bit over
  to the side"* -- and it keeps him crossing a ledge at 0.85 m/s against m102's intended 1.21,
  with every hop now a whole animation.
  **AND TWO MORE CLIPS WERE PLAYING AT 1.0 IN STATES THAT ARE NOT THEIR LENGTH.** m102's own note
  says the mantle *"is the 1.208 s clip compressed to (x1.55)"* and **nothing ever set a rate**,
  so it ran at 1.0 over a 0.78 s state and **the last 0.43 s of the climb was never shown** --
  the m8 landmine, live and written up as though it had been done. The push-off is the same:
  1.333 s over `awayDur` .55, so 41% of it. Both are compressed where the state is entered.
  **A NOTE THAT DESCRIBES A RATE IS NOT A RATE**, which is this file's own sentence about a
  comment describing an intent the code does not have, for the fourth time.

- **THE CHARGED DASH WAS THE ONE STRIKE IN THE FILE THAT NEVER STORED ITS OWN BEARING (m105,
  `chargeRelease`).** *"Sometimes I'll have my weapon out and I'll swing at them, I'll launch and
  hit them, and they go off like to the side -- the trajectory doesn't look right, it feels like
  they should go the direction of my body vector."*
  **m97 FIXED THIS AND THIS FUNCTION WAS NOT IN THE FIX.** `strikeSweep` launches along `p.melH`,
  and `meleeGo` and `kickGo` both write it beside `p.faceH`; `chargeRelease` writes `p.faceH`,
  `p.heading` and `p.camWant` and **not `p.melH`** -- so a charged dash launched its man along
  whatever bearing the LAST ORDINARY PUNCH was thrown at, and that value is never cleared, so it
  is stale for the rest of the session after the first flick. Aimed at one man, launched toward
  another, every time.
  **IT IS THE m97 BUG WEARING ITS OTHER FACE.** There the bearing was RECOVERED FROM GEOMETRY
  (the limb's instantaneous delta, which at the contact frame is mostly tangential); here it was
  simply NOT STORED, and both come out as *"they go off to the side"*. **When a direction is
  already decided, store it where it is decided** -- `p.melH` is written on the same line as
  `p.faceH` in all three places now, so the lens, his nose and the launch are one answer rather
  than three that can disagree.
  **AND THE SLAM IS CORRECTLY NOT THIS.** `slamLand` throws each man radially OUTWARD from where
  it landed, which is one bearing PER BODY -- a single `melH` would be the wrong answer for it.

- **THE LUNGE WAS FEEDING THE TACKLE GATE, AND THE FINISHER ALONE ARMED IT (m105, `p.runT`).**
  *"I'll just be swiping melee melee melee and then all of a sudden he launches past the
  character quite a distance... it's almost like when there's a guy in front of you he only goes
  a short distance, which I like, but then if you melee and it doesn't clock that there's a guy
  in his trajectory it launches far."* His reading of the symptom is exactly right and the cause
  is one line:
      if (p.grounded && p.speed > MELEE.slideAt) p.runT += dt; else p.runT = 0;
  **`stepMelee` REWRITES THE VELOCITY FROM `melV` EVERY FRAME**, so a strike's own lunge is
  counted here as running. Tabled against the shipped constants, time spent over `slideAt` 4.2
  against a `slideT` of .45:
      link 1  lunge 7.0  beat .62  free travel 3.15 m   over 4.2 for 0.42 s   no
      link 2        6.5       .68               3.20            0.44          no
      link 3        9.0       .82               4.60            **0.61 s**    **YES**
  **So throwing the finisher was by itself enough to arm the tackle** -- and a three-punch chain
  ENDS on the finisher, so the very next fresh flick after any completed chain was a slide.
  Against a locked jab at a man 2 m off (1.25 m of travel) a 6.20 m free tackle is **five times**
  the distance, which is his "two or three times" if anything understated.
  **AND IT IS WHY HE COULD NOT SEE A PATTERN**: nothing about the second flick is different --
  the difference was made by the strike BEFORE it.
  **THE GATE MEANS "DID HE ARRIVE AT THIS FLICK RUNNING", AND A MAN ARRIVING OUT OF HIS OWN LAST
  PUNCH IS NOT RUNNING, HE IS FIGHTING.** So the clock does not tick while a move owns the body
  (`p.melee || p.chargeGo || p.roll`). **HELD, NOT CLEARED**: a man genuinely sprinting who
  throws one punch on the way in still has his run time when it ends, and between strikes in a
  standing fight he is under 4.2 anyway so it resets by itself.
  **THIS IS `p.rHold` ONE REPO OVER** -- a shared quantity accumulated in a state where it does
  not mean what its name says. m88 wrote the gate, m97 fixed the DISTANCE half of the same
  complaint and explicitly left the trigger; this is the trigger.
  **THE DISTANCES ARE UNTOUCHED, DELIBERATELY.** With the trigger honest, a tackle only happens
  when he really did run at somebody, which is when a long slide is wanted -- and moving two
  variables at once means neither can be judged. `mel.MELEE.slideT` is the dial.

- **A BLOCK IS NOT A HIT, AND IT WAS PLAYING THE SOUND OF BEING ONE (m105, `BLOCK.ping`).**
  *"When we do a block animation it needs to make a different noise than the noise that it makes
  when you're hit -- so like the clang or clink or something, like a parry noise."* `playerHurt`
  ends with `snd('thud')` unconditionally, and `thud` is `box_break_01` -- **HIS being hit**. So a
  guarded blow played the hit sound with the block's own ring under it, which is m27's duplicate
  with the two halves describing different events.
      guard    the ring alone, `fxRing * .6` -- steel absorbing it
      deflect  the ring at full, plus `metal_ping_01` on top -- turned aside
  **THE PING IS PLAYED FROM ITS OWN PEAK (`cut`)**, which is what makes a bright short file read
  as an ARRIVAL rather than as a swell -- m59's mechanism, and `HCHG.snd`'s own trick one event
  over. Two layers and one event, which is m64's argument: the ring is what the blow lands ON.
  **AND THE RED FLASH GOES WITH THE DAMAGE, NOT WITH THE CONTACT.** A deflect is `cutHard` 0, so
  flashing the screen told him he was hurt when he was not. A partial guard still costs him a
  quarter and still flashes.

- **CLANCY FLOATS BECAUSE NOTHING IN THE FILE KNOWS WHERE HIS BACK IS (m105, `PACK.mark`).**
  *"I'm wondering if it would be helpful for me to put in a root or a joint where Clancy should
  go, because he just sort of looks like he's standing floating slightly above the backpack. I
  want him to be holding onto the backpack, and I need to put in a custom animation for him."*
  **BOTH HALVES ARE HIS AND BOTH ARE THE RIGHT CALL**, and the code is written to take each the
  moment it exists rather than waiting for a build.
  **THE SEAT.** m104 found the spine by pattern and hung him off it by two fractions of
  `RIG.height` -- which is the honest answer when there is no marker, and is a GUESS by
  construction: nothing about the geometry of a backpack is in this file. `PACK.mark` is tried
  first, and **a named joint IS the placement: no offset, no rotation, nothing typed.** That is
  `weapFit`'s rule, and it is why the weapon mounts needed no code change when his export grew
  them. **It has to be IN THE SKIN to arrive as a Bone** -- `buildRig` collects `o.isBone`, which
  is what GLTFLoader makes of a node a skin lists as a joint -- so exporting it the way he
  exported `weapon_root` is the whole of it.
  **THE POSE.** `stand_to_cover` is a stand-in and it is exactly why he reads as standing: it is
  a man taking COVER, not a man holding on. `PACK.clips.ride` is an ordered list now and the
  first name the body actually has wins, so drawing one and calling it `pack_ride` needs no code
  change -- `CLIPS.block`'s pattern and `BAR.mark`'s.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS WHICH SEAT IT IS USING.** `· PACK` is the joint and `· PACK?` is the guess,
  because *"he floats above the backpack"* and *"the joint never arrived"* are one picture from a
  phone. Silent about it once the joint is there, `rollREC`'s rule.

- **THE GUARD ARMED PERFECTLY AND HE WAS FACING THE WRONG WAY (m103, `findLock`'s guard hold).**
  *"When I'm blocking and the Warriors hit me it doesn't block their attack -- I think I'm still
  just getting hit. And you should be able to block in any of the three modes: disarmed, with the
  weapon or with the blaster."*
  **THE SECOND HALF WAS ALREADY TRUE AND THE FIRST WAS NOT THE BLOCK.** Driven through the shipped
  `stepKit`, `p.block` arms on a down-hold in **all three slots** (m37 never gated it on one and
  m39's `bare` handling covers the unarmed pose), and `playerHurt`'s tiers fire correctly against a
  blow from dead ahead. What the probe found instead, against a REAL warrior over 25 s with the
  guard held the whole time:
      block=1 on every blow, and **off 2.30 and 2.67 radians** -- 132 and 153 degrees off
      so `BLOCK.arc` 1.25 could never once apply, and every mace landed in full
  **THE CONE IS MEASURED OFF `cam.az` AND THE GUARD THUMB CANNOT MOVE THE CAMERA.** Acquiring
  inside 45 degrees of 12 o'clock is his own spec and is right; KEEPING it there is not, because
  `foePlan` circles -- and the right pad is held DOWN, so there is no way to turn the lens after
  him. The man leaves the cone, the lock drops, `faceTgt` falls back to a frozen `cam.az`, and the
  guard is pointed at nothing while he is hit from behind.
  **SO THE GUARD LOCK IS A COMMITMENT: in range and on his feet, he stays yours.** Nothing steals
  him, so there is nothing to flicker -- and it is what *"it locks on them and then you can kind of
  rotate around them"* asks for literally. The cost is that you cannot switch targets without
  letting go of the guard; that is the trade rather than an oversight.
  **AND A BLOCKED BLOW WAS KNOCKING THE GUARD OFF, WHICH IS THE FIX BREAKING ITSELF.** The shove
  branch ran `if (p.grounded && !p.knock) { p.vel.y = up; p.grounded = false; }` -- and a guard
  sets `up` to ZERO, so it took his feet off the floor with no velocity to show for it. The
  guard's own `busy` reads that as airborne: `p.block` to 0, `p.lock` with it, and the NEXT swing
  arrived with him facing wherever the frozen camera pointed. One clause (`up > 0`), and the probe
  reads the difference exactly:
      before the commitment   guard held, 3 parried and the 4th full at off 2.30
      commitment only         3 parried, the 4th full at off 3.07 with `lock=n`
      and with `up > 0`       **7 swings, 7 parried, off 0.00 on every one**
      no guard, same fight    3 swings, 3 full hits, 12 damage each
- **THE MACE REACHED A METRE OF THIN AIR AND ARRIVED 108 ms LATE (m103, `FOE.swingAt`, `hitR`).**
  *"He did this uppercut swing and the swing didn't hit me, but then when he brought his bat back
  down to rest, then it hit me -- it just looked wrong, the swing needs to hit me."* Both halves
  are real, both were numbers nobody had ever measured, and forward kinematics over the real
  samplers answers both in a second (the tip is `weapon_root` + its own local (0, 0, 36.1845), the
  pair `npm run rig` already reads; 120 samples per clip):
      horizontal  tip furthest forward **u 0.39**, **1.64 m** from the root   peak speed u 0.41
      downward                          u 0.38      1.64                      u 0.38
      backhand                          u 0.34      1.48                      u 0.33
      360_low                           u 0.40      1.44                      u 0.40
  **THE BLOW FIRED AT u 0.45**, which on a 1.35 s beat is up to 108 ms after the arc had gone
  past -- his sentence exactly. **AND `hitR` 2.6 plus your own .24 is a hit out to 2.84 m** against
  a tip that gets to 1.64, with `reach` 2.0 as the distance he stops at to throw it: **the mace
  stopped a third of a metre short of you on every swing and connected anyway.** That is the m56
  phantom one body over -- a number that was never taken off the model.
  `swingAt` **.37**, `hitR` **1.9**, and `reach`/`hold` down to 1.45/1.7 with it, because
  `foePlan` clamps both inside `hitR` and **a distance he cannot attack from is not a distance to
  stand at**. He fights from about a metre now, which is what a mace fight is.
- **THE BOLT DIED ON THE SIDEKICK (m103, `WEAP.palThru`).** *"We'll keep it so that the blaster
  still shoots Clancy, but instead of the bullet stopping -- that's the biggest hangup. He still
  goes flying, he gets zapped, whatever, but it doesn't stop the bullet."* The flight test kills
  the bolt on whoever it catches, and the one body in this game you did not aim at is the one
  walking in front of you. **It is the BOLT that changes, not the blow**: he goes through the same
  `dummyHit` as everybody, and what he stops doing is ENDING the shot. `d.cool` is what makes that
  safe with no second test -- he is skipped for the rest of the flight, so one round cannot hit him
  twice on the way past -- and he does not spend `b.onMan` either, or the impact bank, the ring and
  the blast budget would all be spent on somebody the shot was never for.
- **THE KNOCK-DOWN GOES FLATTER AND FURTHER (m103, `HURT.hi`, `HURT.back`).** *"I want when I go
  flying in the air to go in the direction they hit me, and I wanna go kind of horizontal."* The
  DIRECTION was already his -- `dirH` is the way the blow travels and the launch has been built on
  it since m67 -- so what was missing is the SHAPE: 1.60 m of apex against 8.7 m of travel is 5:1,
  which is a lob. **And it cannot be bought by lowering the apex**, because the hang time is what
  the fall clip's rate is solved against (m96): at an apex of 1.0 the flight is 0.63 s and the rate
  wants x2.51 at k 1 and **x2.95 at the bottom of `vary`**, which runs off `rateMax` and puts the
  pose back where m96 found it. So the apex comes down a little and `back` does the work:
      k .85   vy 6.25   apex 0.98 m   air 0.62 s    9.0 m   clip x2.54
      k 1.0   vy 7.35   apex 1.35     air 0.74     12.1 m   clip x2.16
      k 1.20  vy 8.82   apex 1.94     air 0.88     17.1 m   clip x1.80
  Nine to one rather than five, every rate still inside the band, and the hang untouched.
- **`npm run sim` HAD BEEN DYING AT CASE 13 SINCE m52, AND EVERYTHING BELOW IT WAS UNRUN (m103).**
  The charged-dash case set `p.slot = 3` from when rapid fire was its own slot; m52 made it a MODE
  and the roster came down to three, so `slotNow()` returned `undefined` and the next `stepKit`
  threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'aim')`. **A crash is not a red row** --
  nothing reports it and the output simply stops, so eight whole cases have been invisible for
  fifty builds. The slot is FOUND now (`WEAP.slots.findIndex(s => s.charge)`), in all six places
  that typed it.
  **AND IT WAS HIDING TWO SHIPPED BUGS, WHICH IS WHAT A SUITE IS FOR:**
  1. **`FOE` HAD TWO KEYS CALLED `knock` AND THE LAST ONE WON.** `knock: 4.2` is how hard a blow
     SHOVES a warrior (m37/m71); m91 added `knock: 1` forty lines below it for the chance his mace
     puts YOU on the floor. A duplicate key in an object literal is silent in every gate there is,
     and **every blow on a warrior has shoved him at 1 rather than 4.2 since m91**: a fist reads
     0.45 m/s and 0.18 m where m71 sized it at 1.89 and 0.86 -- back under the threshold of being
     an effect, which is the whole of what m71 was about. It is `hitKnock` now.
  2. **AND `chargeRelease` THREW THE HOLD AWAY BEFORE ASKING WHAT IT WAS WORTH.** `p.chargeT` is
     zeroed four lines above the `chargeAim()` call, and that function defaults to reading it --
     so since m51 every charged hammer swing has been aimed and solved at `chg01` **0**: `want`
     5.75 m whatever the thumb did, and `acq` with it. Measured through the shipped function, a
     FULL hold and a HALF hold both read `goGap 5.75, melV 36.31` -- identical to the hundredth,
     with `chargeGoK` correctly 1.000 against .725 beside them, which is the tell. `chargeAim(t0)`.
     After: 11.00 m full, 8.38 half, and a man inside the reach sets the distance.
  **AND FIVE ROWS WERE ASSERTING RULES THE GAME NO LONGER HAS**, every one of them a build that
  changed a rule and could not change its case because the case was unreachable: the step-up asked
  for the 0.40 m box that stopped being walkable at m57 (`MOVE.step` is `.5 * SZ` and came down to
  0.357 with him); two dash rows asked for m43's "goes through him" that m51 deliberately replaced;
  two aim rows asked for m48's .34 dead zone that m50 deliberately narrowed to .20. **When a rule
  changes, its case changes in the same commit** is the sentence at the top of that very block.
  **`reset()` ALSO CARRIED STATE BETWEEN CASES.** The solid-boxes case drives him into a tower with
  the stick held INTO it, which is exactly how `wallGo` latches -- and nothing let go, so the roll
  and the lunge cases were measuring a man in wall cover and reported the previous case's position
  to the centimetre. It clears the wall, the ledge, the knock-down, the guard and the slot now.
  **AND ONE ROW WAS A COIN FLIP ON A SEEDED STREAM.** "He blocks and circles too" reads ONE body,
  and `foeRoll` gives each his own `guard` out of `.22 x [.4, 1.5]` -- so about one man in four
  never guards across a fight, and the row passed only while the seed happened to land right. It
  measures four bodies now, which is what the seeded harness was for: **the spread, not the draw.**
  `npm run sim` is green end to end for the first time since m52.
- **THE LEDGE, AND m89 HAD ALREADY BUILT HALF OF IT (m102, `LEDGE`, `ledgeFind`, `stepLedge`).**
  *"I do want to build the ledge system, hangs on the ledge and get up, and maybe I'll design
  buildings in a way where they always have levels so you can jump, hang, climb up, jump, hang,
  climb up to get up to higher levels."*
  **m88 NAMED THE MISSING PIECE AND m89 SHIPPED IT WITHOUT SAYING SO.** *"Both need something this
  game has never had -- a test for is there a wall/lip near me, and which way does it face."*
  `wallFind` IS that test: the closest point on a box's FOOTPRINT gives the distance to the face
  AND its outward normal in one `clamp` per axis, right whichever side he comes at, and returning
  nothing when he is INSIDE the footprint -- which is exactly what stops him grabbing the roof he
  is standing on. m89's own note says the ledge build wanted that function and that is why the
  wall went first. **So what is actually new here is a HEIGHT TEST and a MANTLE.**
  **A LEDGE IS FOUND, NEVER AUTHORED.** It is the TOP EDGE of the same box, so every roof,
  parapet and setback in `BOXES` is climbable the moment it is placed -- which is what makes
  *"design buildings with levels"* a thing he does in the world builder rather than a second list
  to keep in step. The rails' and the bars' rule, one repo over.
  **AND WHERE HE HANGS IS MEASURED OFF THE CLIP, NOT TYPED.** Walked forward through the real rig
  in `zap.glb` -- each bone's animated rotation where the clip keys one, its rest transform where
  it does not -- and read at `mixamorig_Left/RightHand`:
      ledge_hang_idle   2.375 s   hands **1.076 m above the root**, **0.212 m in front of it**,
                                  hips 0.578, head 0.922, toes 0.415 (he is TUCKED) -- and it
                                  HOLDS: identical to a millimetre at t 0.00 and t 1.20
      ledge_hang_to_get_up_over_ledge  1.208 s, hips XZ **0.000** -- IN PLACE, mantle included
      ledge_hang_to_jump_away 1.333   ledge_hang_hop_left/right 1.54 / 1.71
  **THE TWO PLACEMENT NUMBERS ARE FRACTIONS OF `RIG.height`**, so they survive a re-export at any
  authored size and another change to how tall he is; only a change to the POSE moves them, which
  is the one thing that should. And **the catch band is centred on the SAME offset**, because the
  question is not "how high is the wall" but "is the lip where his hands are" -- so the placement
  number IS the acquire number and the two cannot drift.
  **AND THE HANDS MEASURE TO LOCAL +Z, SO THIS CLIP CARRIES NO HALF TURN.** The wall-cover clip
  does (m99), and that one fact is the whole reason the hop's sign comes out the OPPOSITE way
  round: facing `-n` his right is `(nz, -nx)`, so the tangent `(-nz, nx)` the move is taken along
  is his **LEFT** here and his RIGHT on the wall. Two surfaces, two answers, one derivation each
  -- and this file gets handedness backwards about half the time when it argues instead.
  **THE CONTROLS ARE THE WALL'S, DELIBERATELY.** Left pad is the BODY on both surfaces: into it
  climbs, away lets go (harder than into, with the same grace clock), sideways hops, and the
  right pad's tap jumps off. A man who has learnt cover has learnt this. **And the CATCH has no
  gesture at all** -- he is airborne, his hands are level with an edge, he takes it. Catching one
  while RISING is deliberate: jumping at a fire escape and being caught on the way up is the move.
  **THE SHIMMY IS DISCRETE HERE, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE IT DOES NOT COPY THE WALL** -- because
  `ledge_hang_hop_left/right` are HOPS and the wall's are a slide. The clips decide.
  **UP FIRST, THEN IN.** Lerping straight to the mantle target drags him diagonally THROUGH the
  parapet he is climbing over, which is not a mantle. And the target's height is ASKED
  (`groundAt`) rather than assumed to be the lip, because a mantle onto a stack lands on whichever
  box is highest.
  **HEADROOM IS CHECKED BEFORE THE GRAB, NOT AFTER.** A lip with a wall on top of it is a lip he
  would climb INTO, and there is no graceful way out of that once he is committed.
  **AND IF HE IS GOING TO CLEAR IT, HE LANDS ON IT.** A lip is always at least half a metre above
  his feet (the band is centred on his HANDS), so nothing would have stopped the catch firing at
  the bottom of a jump onto a 1.15 m box -- turning a step-up that has always worked into a hang,
  which is m74's 40 cm cube pointed the other way. Whether this jump clears it is KNOWABLE rather
  than a threshold: the apex from here against the lip, plus `clears` so a jump that only just
  makes it is not a coin toss.
  **THIS IS THE ONE PLACE IT IS CALLED, AND THAT IS THE THING TO CHECK FIRST IF IT EVER DOES
  NOTHING.** Shredworld spent a whole build on a ledge grab that was correct and reachable only by
  being hit by a car, because `ledgeGrab` was called from the knock-down integrator and nowhere
  else. This sits in the ordinary air path, above the gait, where a man who has jumped passes.
  **AND THE TEST SITE GETS SOMETHING TO CLIMB**, because a ledge system shipped with nothing in
  the world to catch is a system he cannot judge. Four levels three metres apart, spiralling round
  a 12 x 12 m block at (20..32, -25..-13). **Three metres is not a taste number, it is what one
  plain jump reaches:**
      from  0.0 -> lip  3.0   hands sweep  1.08.. 3.89   lip band  2.45.. 3.55   CATCH
      from  3.0 -> lip  6.0                4.08.. 6.89             5.45.. 6.55   CATCH
      from  6.0 -> lip  9.0                7.08.. 9.89             8.45.. 9.55   CATCH
      from  9.0 -> lip 12.0               10.08..12.89            11.45..12.55   CATCH
  The double jump and the backflip are needed for NONE of it, which is the point: the ordinary
  jump is the climb. **Checked as rectangles** (m60's rule) against all ten boxes, both buildings
  and all seventeen body spawns; nearest corner 24 m from the spawn.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container has a GPU or can pose a skin at
  runtime, so whether his hands actually sit on the lip, whether the mantle reads and whether the
  hop lands where the clip says are device questions. The arithmetic -- the hand offsets, the
  reach table, the clearances -- is above and was measured. `mel.LEDGE` is live and
  `mel.LEDGE.on = 0` takes the whole thing off.
- **AND HE WAS STANDING TOO FAR OFF THE WALL (m102, `WALL.stand`).** *"The leaning on the wall
  system is fine but he is a little bit far away from the wall."* Measured rather than eyeballed:
  that number is his CENTRE's clearance ON TOP of his own radius, so what he is looking at is the
  gap behind his back.
      stand .30 * SZ = .214   centre .457 off the face  ->  **21 cm of air behind him**
      stand .09 * SZ = .064   centre .307               ->  **6 cm**, which is a man leaning
  It cannot go much under that: `p.r` is .243, so a standoff inside his own radius is a man whose
  collider is in the brick -- harmless while `stepWall` owns him, and `resolveBoxes` shoves him
  back out on the first frame after he lets go, but not a thing to lean on.

- **THE GUARD TOOK THE LOCK BACK, AND EVERY LINE OF IT WAS ALREADY BUILT (m101, `LOCK.block`,
  `findLock`).** *"I think we used to have the lock where once you pushed forward it would lock on
  them and you would basically be rotating around them. We're gonna use the block as that -- if
  somebody is within 45 degrees of your 12 o'clock and you press and hold down on the right stick,
  it sort of locks on them and then you can kind of rotate around them."*
  **HE IS REMEMBERING m20, AND IT HAS BEEN SITTING INTACT AND SWITCHED OFF SINCE m36.**
  `findLock`, `lockH`, `stickLocked`'s orbit, `faceTgt` reading `p.lock`, `stepCam`'s come-round
  and the acquire chirp are all there; **m36's own note is why** -- *"nothing is deleted, which is
  what makes this a decision rather than a rewrite."* So this build is a SECOND SWITCH and a
  second cone, not a second system, and it is the first time that sentence has actually been
  collected on.
  **AND THE REASON IT WAS TURNED OFF DOES NOT REACH THE GUARD.** m36: *"a mark that moves where
  you are POINTING takes the aim off your thumb, so you stop aiming."* **A guard has no aim to
  take.** This moves his BODY and the LENS and nothing else, which is m51's own line -- he has
  turned down two assists that moved his AIM and kept the one that only moves his BODY -- and the
  melee lunge is the third thing on the keep side of it. `LOCK.on` (the blaster's) and
  `LOCK.block` are two switches and must stay two.
  **THE ORBIT IS `stickLocked` AND IT NEEDED NOTHING.** *"You can kind of rotate around them."*
  That function reads the left stick in the TARGET's frame -- up and down close or open the range,
  left and right run along the tangent, and because the tangent is recomputed every frame a
  straight step along it IS a circle. `MOVE.blockSp` 2.4 caps him, so it is a circling shuffle
  rather than a sprint round a post.
  **45 DEGREES IS HIS NUMBER AND IT IS FOUR TIMES THE BLASTER'S ON PURPOSE.** `LOCK.cone` is .19
  (11 deg) because m20/m27 sized it for what a BULLET must deliver; `blockCone` .79 only has to
  notice who is in front of you. `blockRange` 10 rather than 24: a mace reaches 2.6 m, and a lock
  on a man across the street swings the lens off the fight you are in.
  **AND A MAN ON THE FLOOR IS NOT SOMETHING TO GUARD AGAINST** -- `palFoe`'s rule (m75) one state
  over, on the GUARD path only. A downed man is still a perfectly good thing to shoot, so the aim
  lock must not gain it.
- **AND IT ACTUALLY BLOCKS NOW -- WHICH IS A SECOND ARC, NOT A BIGGER NUMBER (m101,
  `BLOCK.perfect`, `blockFx`).** *"We need to make the block actually block and deflect or parry
  or whatever... and if they swing it blocks, and we have an animation for block react."*
  **THE REACT HAS PLAYED SINCE m95** (`HURT.hits` is `weapon_block_reaction`, and with `FOE.knock`
  at 1 a raised guard is the only way to reach it), so that half was already true. What was
  missing is that a guard cost him a flat quarter of the blow from ANYWHERE inside 72 degrees --
  **there was nothing to do well and nothing to do badly.**
      perfect .55   31 deg either side -- DEFLECTED, and it costs nothing
      arc    1.25   72 either side -- the partial guard it has always been
      outside       not blocked at all, exactly as before
  **SO THE LOCK DOES NOT MAKE THE BLOCK STRONGER; IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT POINTED.**
  `faceTgt` reads `p.lock` and comes round at `LOCK.face` 9, so a locked guard sits at about zero
  off and parries by construction, while an unlocked one is steered by the left stick and is luck.
  **That is an assist paying in the one currency this file trusts** -- a thing you were going to do
  anyway, done reliably -- rather than in a damage multiplier nobody can see.
  **AND A BLOCK THAT MAKES NO NOISE IS A NUMBER.** `blockFx` puts the contact in front of his
  chest, back down the blow (`dirH` is the direction the blow TRAVELS, so the man who threw it is
  at `dirH + PI`), as a spark burst plus **m64's ring layer** -- which is what a blow lands ON, and
  here it lands on a raised guard, the most literal reading that layer has ever had. A deflect is
  hotter, louder and knocks the lens; **only a deflect knocks it**, because a shake on every
  guarded blow is a shake on most of a fight and m99's own note is that it has to read as ONE
  thump.
  **AND THE RING UNDER HIS FEET IS m51's, BORROWED.** A lock you cannot see is a lock you cannot
  trust, and `markRing` is already the right idiom: a mark ON a man is a lock you stop playing
  around, one on the FLOOR under him is a fact about the world. Steady rather than breathing --
  there is nothing filling, so a closing ring would be drawing a number that does not exist.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `PARRY` OR `BLOCK`**, because *"it didn't block"* and *"it blocked and I still
  took it"* are the two bugs this build could have, and `· LOCK` above says whether it had anybody.
- **AND THE GUARD HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THE NARROW CAMERA DEAD ZONE SINCE m37 (m101).** m48's
  argument is about the residual x a HELD thumb carries, and that is the same whichever way it is
  held -- so a block has been drifting the lens at up to 45 deg/s under a thumb asking for nothing.
  It matters now the guard LOCKS, because the drift fights the come-round and the two settle at
  `drift / LOCK.cam` of permanent error:
      x .30 residual, dead .06     ->  0.71 rad/s  ->  the lock parks **17 deg** off his nose
                      deadAim .12  ->  0.53        ->  **12.7 deg**
  Both hold (`blockCone` is 45 and `perfect` 31), so this is steadiness rather than a fix for
  something broken -- but 17 degrees of permanent lean is half the parry window.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container has a GPU or can build a skin, so
  whether 45 degrees is too eager, whether the orbit reads as circling him, and whether the parry
  spark reads as a deflect are device questions. `mel.LOCK.block = 0` is the one word back to m100,
  `mel.BLOCK.perfect = 0` turns the deflect off alone, and `mel.MARK.on = 0` drops the ring.

- **THE PUSH GETS ITS OWN RATE, AND m97 STRETCHED THE ONE SEGMENT NOBODY WANTED STRETCHED
  (m100, `AIR.pushRate`, `flipAirRate`).** *"Once you release the backflip it like slows, you're
  just like on the ground for a bit -- the portion from being down released to then jumping is too
  long. Are we able to speed up just a segment of it so that he jumps sooner after release?"*
  **ONE RATE WAS FITTED TO THE WHOLE CLIP, SO SLOWING THE AIR SLOWED THE LEGS WITH IT.** m92 found
  that `backflip` spends **0.333 s PUSHING on the floor** after its crouch and held him down for
  it, which was right; m97 then fitted the rate to the hang, and because that rate divides the
  push as well, **the bigger the jump the longer he stood there before it**:
      charge 0.00   air rate 0.965   push 0.333 / 0.965 = **0.345 s** on the floor after the lift
      charge 0.50             0.788                      0.423
      charge 1.00             0.682                      **0.488 s**
  m97 wrote that up as a feature -- *"a deeper crouch for a bigger jump"* -- and named the second
  rate as the thing it was avoiding. **Half a second between the thumb leaving the pad and the
  body leaving the floor is not a crouch, it is latency you can feel**, which is the one thing
  `SLAM.hang` gets to spend and a release does not.
  **THE DELAY IS WHAT HAS TO BE CONSTANT, WHICH IS WHY IT IS AN ABSOLUTE RATE AND NOT A
  MULTIPLIER.** The thumb is judging the gap between its own lift and the jump, and that gap
  should not be a function of how long it was held. Every charge now leaves the ground **0.151 s**
  after the release and **the air rate is untouched at m97's own numbers**, so the rotation still
  fills the trip exactly as it did -- one variable moved.
  **IT MAY ONLY EVER SPEED THE PUSH UP** (`max(airRate, pushRate)`): on a short hang the air rate
  is already over 1, and a typed 2.2 there would be the fix RE-BREAKING the case it is here for,
  one sign over. A clip with no wind-up (`front_flip`, `off` 0.000) has no push to speed up and
  keeps one rate end to end, with no case of its own.
  **AND THE SPLIT THAT LOOKS HONEST IS THE ONE m97 ALREADY REJECTED.** Fitting the air SEGMENT
  (`air - off`, 0.792 s of clip) to the hang gives 0.792 / 1.649 = **0.48x**, which is the slow
  motion that note turned down. So the air keeps reading `M.air / T`, which spans the push as well
  and is deliberately an approximation: the clip's LANDING frame arrives a little before he does,
  and the TAKE-OFF frame -- the one being complained about -- now arrives exactly when he leaves.
  **THE RATE IS WRITTEN WITH `timeScale`, NEVER A REPLAY.** The mixer reads it every update, so it
  moves the clock from that frame on and leaves the clip where the push left it; `reset()` or a
  second `playOnce` rewinds to the crouch and plays the wind-up again in mid-air, which is exactly
  the fault m92 removed. It is written at the launch frame in `stepPlayer` and in `backGo`'s own
  no-hang branch, so a clip that somehow has no push cannot be left running at the wrong rate.
  **AND `backGo` STOPPED INVERTING `flipDur` TO RECOVER THE HANG.** With two rates there is
  nothing to invert: the function that CHOSE how fast the wind-up plays is the function that knows
  how long it takes (`p.flipPush`), and a second derivation is a second place for the clip and the
  physics to drift apart.
  **The chip already said `PUSH<t>`** (m92), so this is one glance to confirm: `PUSH0.15` at every
  charge, where it used to read 0.35 to 0.49. `mel.AIR.pushRate = 0` is the one word back to m97,
  because it floors at the air rate.

- **THE CLIP ALREADY CONTAINED THE HALF TURN, SO THE ROOT MUST NOT (m99).** *"The wall cover is
  backwards. The animations has the face away from wall built in, but you rotated him so now he
  faces the wall."* Exactly that, and it is one sign. m89 pointed the root along **+normal** and
  wrote `// belly AWAY from the wall` beside it -- true of the ROOT and false of the body, because
  the clip turns him 180 on top of it. Two half turns compose into a man with his nose in the
  brick. `atan2(-W.nx, -W.nz)`: the root faces the wall and the clip's own turn puts the belly out.
  **AND THE SHIMMY'S SIGN CAME RIGHT WITH IT, which is worth writing down rather than
  re-deriving.** `side` is measured along `(-nz, nx)`. Under m89's facing that tangent was the
  ROOT's right and therefore the DRAWN body's LEFT, so `wallShimmy`'s `side > 0 -> R` was picking
  the wrong clip as well -- invisible, because the facing was already wrong in the same direction.
  Facing the wall, the drawn body's right IS that tangent and the pick is correct by construction.
  **A COMMENT DESCRIBING AN INTENT THE CODE NO LONGER HAS IS THE TELL**, which is this file's own
  sentence about the 40 cm cube (m74) and `blast0` (m56), for the third time.

- **THE PICK-UP IS GONE, AND `bodyLaunch` IS NOT A LEFTOVER (m99).** *"We're gonna need to remove
  the Clancy pick up because the UI button looks horrible. It's way too big. The hybrid animations
  look like trash. The hips rotation has been stripped. He's leaning forward and the throw
  mechanics are bad. We needs to rebuild all that."* So the whole of m96's carry goes: `#grabRing`
  and its keyframes, the face SVG on the knob, `GRAB`, `grabScan`, `grabGo`, `grabRide`, `tossGo`,
  `tossFire`, `grabDrop`, `stepGrab`, `p.carry`/`p.toss`/`p.wind`/`p.grabNear`, `d.held`,
  `CLIPS.hold`/`toss`, their entries in `SPLIT.up` and `ONCE`, CLANCY's `lift`/`tint`, the guards
  in `pushBodies`/`bodySep`/`cycleKit`, the `'held'` branch in `stepDummies` and the chip line.
  **The right pad's tap is the jump again and nothing else.**
  **`hold_item` AND `throw_item` COST NOTHING NOW THEY ARE UNNAMED**, which is m35's rule: the
  mixer builds an action per clip either way and nothing plays one nobody names. They are there
  for the rebuild.
  **WHAT SURVIVES IS `bodyLaunch`, AND DELETING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MISTAKE.** m96 EXTRACTED it
  from `dummyBlow` -- the tumble, the whoosh, the fall clip, the per-body beat and the two get-up
  rolls -- and `dummyBlow` is still its caller. Removing the feature that motivated an extraction
  is not a reason to put the extraction back inline.
  **AND THE `SPLIT.up` PRIORITY COLLAPSES BACK TO ONE ARM.** m96 made `upNm` a three-way because
  three things wanted the top half; with two of them gone it is `p.swap ? CLIPS.swap : ''` again.

- **THE DIVE WAS FINE AND IT COULD NOT BE REACHED (m99, `palDive`).** *"Clancy is still constantly
  in my way. I feel like if I shoot or charge he need to run or dive out of the way IMMEDIATELY.
  No long. Right stick = get the fuck out of the way."*
  **THREE BUILDS TUNED THE TRIGGER AND THE PROBLEM WAS ITS ADDRESS.** m76 moved it onto `p.armT`
  (the frame the thumb ARRIVES, which is the earliest thing there is to know) and m81 solved the
  distance off the wedge -- both real and both shipped, and both sitting inside `foeWander`, which
  `foeAI` reaches **only after three committed-state returns.** A pounce swing is `swingDur` .85 s
  of a body that cannot dive, and the pounce is live precisely while the trigger is (m75: a mark
  is a body you just hit). **So the one moment he is nearest the muzzle was the one moment the
  reflex was switched off** -- which is his sentence exactly, and it is why m81's habit fix helped
  and did not finish the job.
  **FOURTH TIME ACROSS THESE REPOS: WHEN A FEATURE DOES NOT FIRE, CHECK WHERE IT IS CALLED BEFORE
  WHAT IT DOES** -- after `barCatch` under the collider, `colinAnim` skipped on the bar and
  `stepFeet` above the branch that owns the body (m70). It is the FIRST thing `foeAI` asks now, so
  a punch is abandoned mid-arc.
  **A HOP AND A DIVE ARE THE TWO IT MUST NOT INTERRUPT**, because both hand the body to `bodyFly`:
  cutting a hop in mid-air drops him, and re-diving mid-dive is a stutter rather than a scramble.
  **AND ABANDONING A SWING HAS TO LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND** -- `d.combo` would otherwise carry an
  unfinished chain into the next fight and `d.sfoe` a target that has moved.
  **THE NUMBERS ARE THE REST OF THE SENTENCE.** `dur` .55 -> .45 (x4.17 on a 1.875 s roll, the fast
  end of what a clip can sell), `vMax` 7.5 -> 11.5 so one dive covers 5.18 m of wedge rather than
  4.13, `cool` .25 -> .12 so a second may start 0.57 s after the first rather than 0.80, and
  `cone` .52 -> .60 with `clear` 1.30 -> **1.20**. That last pair is not two independent dials:
  they MULTIPLY into the distance he has to cover, so widening the cone without narrowing the
  clear is a wider wedge he can no longer leave, which is m81's whole finding. Measured through
  the shipped solve, dead on the line: 3 m -> one dive at 5.9 m/s; 5 m -> one at 9.8; 11 m -> two,
  1.02 s in total.

- **THE GROUND FEELS THE SLAM, AND THE SLASH WAS UNDER THE THRESHOLD OF BEING AN EFFECT (m99,
  `slamFx`, `camShake`, `MFX.slam`).** *"When he does the earth slam from melees down from in the
  air we needs to make the ground feels it like a particles effects or debris or shake or slashes
  -- oh by the way we needs to put in the slashes for all the melees stuff."*
  **A SHOCKWAVE IS A RING AND `spkBurst` THROWS A SPHERE**, which is right for a fist arriving at a
  man's chest and wrong for a body arriving at the floor: everything that moves goes OUTWARD and
  low. So it is its own loop -- an EVEN fan of bearings, jittered (a purely random set clumps and
  reads as a spray; an exactly even one reads as a cog) -- and **two rings rather than one**: a
  fast bright grit and a slow dim dust behind it, which is m39's "an impact is three things"
  pointed at the ground. **It is sized off `SLAM.r`**, the radius the blow actually catches, so the
  debris says how far it reached rather than being a number nobody can check.
  **THE SHAKE IS A DECAYING SINE, NOT PER-FRAME NOISE.** A random offset every frame is a BUZZ and
  its character changes with the frame rate; two out-of-phase sinusoids on a half-life read as one
  thump and are identical at 30 Hz and at 120 -- `Math.exp(-k*dt)`'s own argument applied to a
  picture. **AND IT LANDS ON `camera.position`, NEVER ON `cam.pos`**: that one is a DAMPED state,
  so a wobble written into it feeds back through the damper for the rest of the session, which is
  the Verlet constraint banking its correction as velocity one system over. The look point is
  untouched, so the subject stays centred and the WORLD swings.
  **AND THE SLAM HAD NO SLASH BECAUSE `strikeSweep` HAS EXACTLY ONE CALL SITE** -- inside
  `p.roll || p.melee || p.chargeGo`, and a slam is none of the three. `slamGo` has seeded the sweep
  (`p.swPrev = null`) since m81, which says it was always meant to run. It is called with **`live`
  false**: the slam's damage is RADIAL and `slamLand` deals it, so a swept limb counting a second
  blow on the way down would be two descriptions of one event.
  **THE TRAIL ITSELF WAS REAL AND INVISIBLE.** Every strike has drawn one since m94 -- three 10 cm
  sparks with a 0.12 s life, which is not something you can see at ten metres on a phone. 6 at
  .155 over .19 s. **The mechanism was right and the numbers were under the threshold of being an
  effect**, which is m71's own finding: a distance you can see and a duration you can see are the
  same number in disguise. `mel.MFX.per = 3` is the way back.
  **AND THE CHIP'S `!` ON A SLAM IS SET BY THE RADIAL BLOW**, because the sweep cannot answer it
  any more -- it is not `live`. `mel.slamfx()` fires the whole thing where he stands and
  `mel.shake(.5)` is the knock alone, so the two can be judged apart.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container has a GPU or a skin, so whether the
  ring reads as debris, whether 0.55 m of lens knock is a thump or a lurch, and whether a six-spark
  ribbon reads as a slash are all device questions. `mel.MFX.slam` and `mel.CAM.shake` are live.

- **A TAP WAS A THUMB NEAR THE MIDDLE, AND THE MIDDLE IS ELEVEN PER CENT OF THE PAD (m98,
  `MOVE.tapMove`).** *"It feels really tough to hit the exact middle of the stick sometimes --
  like 75 per cent of the time when I'm running and I try to jump I miss, and I don't know if
  that's just because of the size of the sticks."* **It is not the size of the sticks.** Read
  straight off `bindStick`:
      if (!fired && onTap && far < MOVE.tapR && held < MOVE.tapT) onTap();
  `far` is the high-water DEFLECTION from the pad's CENTRE, seeded on `pointerdown` and maxed on
  every move -- so `tapR` .42 against `RAD` 52 means **a thumb landing more than 21.8 px from the
  middle of a 132 px pad could never be a tap, however briefly it was there.**
      the tap disc   r 21.8 px      the pad   r 66 px      -> **11.0% of its area**
  And the 89% that was dead is exactly where a thumb reaching across from a running grip lands:
  low and outward. His three quarters is, if anything, generous.
  **WHERE HE LANDED SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A TAP -- WHAT HE DID NEXT DOES.** So the
  test is TRAVEL from the landing point, and the radius did not change: it is the same 21.8 px,
  measured from where the thumb arrived instead of from the middle of the pad. A drag is tens of
  pixels and a flick is caught first (`fired` eats the tap), so nothing that already meant
  something else becomes a tap.
  **AND IT IS ITS OWN CONSTANT, NOT A SECOND JOB FOR `tapR`.** `far` still means "near the
  centre" and `onRel`/`backGo` and the duck's own `R.far < tapR` still read it that way -- which
  is correct there, because m87's duck IS a hold at rest and one sweep anywhere in the hold has
  to kill it. Two facts, two numbers, which is this file's own rule about `chargeGoH`.
  **THE ONE CASE THAT CHANGES BEHAVIOUR, SAID OUT LOUD:** a thumb that lands at the TOP of the
  pad and lifts inside `tapT` .30 now also jumps. That gesture fired nothing before -- it is
  under `armT` on the way in and under `WEAP.minChg` on the way out -- so what it buys is a jump
  where there was silence, which is the right answer for a tap.
  **AND THE TWO PADS CANNOT CROSS-TALK**, which was his third hypothesis (*"maybe the jump isn't
  registering because I'm also holding the other stick"*): each pad is its own element with its
  own listeners and its own closed-over `id`, every handler opens `if (e.pointerId !== id)
  return`, and the window-level catcher matches by id before handing an up to a pad. **And the
  double-tap guard cannot eat it either** -- that one cancels a `touchend`, and the pads run on
  POINTER events, which are not the compatibility layer it fires in.
  **WHAT IS STILL NOT DONE IS THE FLOATING PAD** -- m49 wrote it down and it is still the real
  fix for missing a stick: *"since we don't have the whole adjusting joystick thing on, which
  maybe we should think about in the future"*. A pad that appears where the thumb lands makes
  this question disappear rather than widening its answer.

- **A WEAPON THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DRAWN HAS NEVER BEEN COMPILED (m98).** *"There is sometimes this
  delay in the animation between switching weapons or something -- it's subtle, but it feels like
  there is a slight hang every so often."*
  **THE SWAP ITSELF ALLOCATES NOTHING, WHICH IS WHAT MADE THIS WORTH LOOKING PAST.** `mountWeapon`
  runs once at LOAD -- the clone, the bounds, `measureHue`, `hueGlow` -- and `applySlot` is three
  assignments and `paintKit`, whose entire scene-side effect is `w.group.visible = (key === s.key)`.
  Nothing is created, nothing is disposed, no geometry is touched.
  **BUT THREE COMPILES AND LINKS A PROGRAM THE FIRST TIME A MATERIAL IS ACTUALLY DRAWN**, and both
  weapons are mounted with `visible = false`. Slot 0 is unarmed, so **neither the blaster nor the
  hammer has a program until the first swap TO it** -- a GLSL compile and link mid-frame, once per
  weapon per session, which is 10 to 80 ms on a mobile GPU. That is "sometimes" said exactly: it
  happens, it stops happening, and it happens again on the next reload -- and he reloads for every
  build.
  **`renderer.compile` TRAVERSES WITH `traverse`, NOT `traverseVisible`** -- checked in the
  vendored source rather than assumed, because the lights half of that same function DOES use
  `traverseVisible` and the two are one call apart. So one line at the end of `init()` warms every
  material in the scene, the two hidden ones included.
  **IT IS A CANDIDATE WITH A MECHANISM, NOT A DIAGNOSIS.** Nothing in this container has a GPU, so
  whether a program compile is what he is feeling cannot be answered here. It is in a `try` and it
  is a no-op for anything already up, so the cost of being wrong is nothing.
  **AND THE OTHER CANDIDATE IS NOT SHIPPED WITH IT, DELIBERATELY.** `#modeRow` and `#grabRing` both
  flip `display` between `none` and shown on a swap, which forces a layout and restarts the ring's
  infinite keyframe animation; `visibility` + `opacity` would make that a paint. **Each toggle has
  to move one variable** or neither can be judged, and that one has no mechanism that reaches tens
  of milliseconds. It is the next thing to try if this changes nothing.

- **THE ZIP WAS THE TACKLE, AND IT IS m93 OVER-CORRECTED (m97, `MELEE.slideThru`/`slideMin`).**
  *"There's this thing that happens when you're meleeing where he's hitting the guys and then all
  of a sudden he zips past them by a long distance and I can't figure out why."*
  **EVERY ORDINARY STRIKE IS CAPPED AND SOLVES DOWN TO THE MAN**, which is what made this hard to
  see -- tabled from the shipped constants before anything was touched:
      link 1  melee_01  dur 1.26  v 5.03  travel **4.60 m**   (`lungeMax`)
      link 2  melee_02  dur 0.88  v 6.50         4.15
      link 3  melee_03  dur 0.79  v 8.08         4.60
      locked on a man 5.6 m off -- all three end **1.05 m from him**, by construction
      TACKLE                                     **6.20 m, whoever is in front of him**
  **THE TACKLE IS THE ONE THING IN THE FILE WHOSE DISTANCE STOPPED ANSWERING TO ANYBODY.** m93's
  complaint was the opposite -- the solve CUT IT SHORT (6.20 m free, 1.25 m against a man at 2 m)
  -- and `slideFree` answered it by making the solve a floor-only raise. That is one step too far:
  a floor that is never beaten is not a floor, it is a constant.
  **AND IT FIRES MID-FIGHT, WHICH IS WHY IT READS AS A GLITCH RATHER THAN AS A MOVE.** `tackle`
  needs only `!cont` and `runT >= slideT` .45, so a chain that lapses (`window` 1.05 s) while he
  is moving turns the very next flick into a slide and he leaves the fight he was in. **He never
  asked for a tackle at that moment and there is nothing on screen that says he is about to get
  one**, which is the whole of *"I can't figure out why"*.
  **THE ANSWER IS A TARGET, NOT A FLOOR: HE SLIDES THROUGH HIM AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE.**
      nobody      6.20 m, unchanged -- the "nice long slide tackle" m93 was actually about
      man at 1.0  3.60 m  (`slideMin`; a slide has to be a slide)   2.60 m past him
      man at 2.0  4.20                                              2.20 past
      man at 3.5  5.70                                              2.20 past
      man at 6.0  7.50  (`slideMax`)                                1.50 past
  `hitAll` and the swept limb still catch everyone he passes, which is what m93 was right about
  and is untouched. `mel.MELEE.slideThru = 99` is the one word back.
  **AND THE ACQUIRE RADIUS HAD TO COME DOWN WITH IT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS.** An
  ordinary strike stops `arrive` SHORT of the man, so it may acquire one that much further off; a
  tackle goes THROUGH, so the furthest it can deliver is exactly `slideMax`. At `maxD + arrive`
  a man at 8 m was acquired and the slide stopped **0.5 m short of him** -- m20's rule (an
  assist's range is sized for what it DELIVERS, not for what it draws), which the aim-through
  shape quietly moved.
  **THE FLYING KICK KEEPS ITS FLOOR AND THAT IS A STATED GAP.** It has the same shape -- a kick at
  a man 1 m off still carries 5.85 m -- and it is left alone because he named the ground melee and
  because a kick thrown across the air that overshoots lands you on your feet rather than in the
  middle of nowhere. `airMax` is the dial if it turns out to read the same way.

- **A FIST TRAVELS IN AN ARC, SO ITS DELTA AT CONTACT IS ACROSS THE SWING (m97, `p.melH`).**
  *"The melees send the guys but they don't really get sent in the direction that you swing -- it
  feels like they shoot at an angle away from his swing, where I want them to go the direction I
  swing."* Exactly right, and the mechanism is precise. `strikeSweep` launched him along
      const bh = Math.atan2(_sw.x - q.x, _sw.z - q.z);
  which is the limb's **instantaneous world delta** on the contact frame. A punch is a rotation
  about the shoulder, so at the moment the fist arrives most of that delta is TANGENTIAL -- across
  his body -- and a blow thrown straight ahead sent the man sideways. A hook sent him nearly
  perpendicular to the hook. **It has been that way since m20** and only became visible once blows
  started launching people properly (m91's always-knock, m93's tackle, m96's arc).
  **WHEN A DIRECTION IS ALREADY STORED, DO NOT RECOVER IT FROM GEOMETRY** -- `copFly`'s rule one
  repo over, and the second time this file has paid for it. `p.melH` is the bearing the strike was
  actually thrown at, AFTER `meleeLock` has had its say, stored in the two places it is decided
  (`meleeGo` and `kickGo`) beside the facing and the camera want -- so the lens, his nose and the
  launch are ONE answer rather than three that can disagree.
  **AND IT SERVES THE BODY MOVES WITH NO SECOND CASE**, because on a tackle or a flying kick the
  direction he is TRAVELLING is the direction he aimed. The slam is untouched: it throws each man
  radially OUTWARD from where it landed, which is one bearing per body and correctly not this one.
  `mel.MELEE.limbDir = 1` puts the tangent back for an A/B.

- **THE FLIP FILLS THE WHOLE TRIP, AND THE FLOOR OF 1 WAS THE WHOLE BUG (m97, `AIR.rateLo`).**
  *"The backflip finishes when he's still in the air, so we need to map the animation to the whole
  air trip."* m87 wrote the rate as `max(1, M.air / (T * fill))` on the argument that stretching a
  clip to fill a long hang is slow motion -- a real concern, and not what was happening:
      the clip is **1.125 s** from its crouch to its landing
      a FULL-charge backflip is 0.333 s of push + **1.649 s** of air = 1.982 s
      the ideal rate is 1.125 / 1.649 = **0.682**, and the floor clamped it to 1.00
      so the flip was over at 1.458 s and the last **0.52 s** was `in_air`
  At `fill` 1 and `rateLo` .62 the trip is covered exactly, at every charge:
      charge 0.00   apex 3.40   air 1.17   rate 0.965   push 0.35   **0.00 s left over**
      charge 0.50        5.10       1.43        0.788        0.42        0.00
      charge 1.00        6.80       1.65        0.682        0.49        0.00
  **AND THE PUSH STRETCHES WITH IT, WHICH IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.** `backGo`
  derives the hang back out of the same rate, so a full charge winds up for 0.49 s against 0.33 --
  a deeper crouch for a bigger jump. Holding the push at 1x and slowing only the air was the
  alternative and it is worse twice over: it needs a second rate written onto the action mid-clip,
  and it puts the air at **0.48x** rather than 0.68x.
  **IT APPLIES TO THE FRONT FLIP TOO**, because it is the same fault -- `front_flip`'s 0.667 s
  against a double jump's ~1.0 s of air was ending a third of the way early as well. He named the
  backflip because it is the one that hangs longest. `mel.AIR.rateLo = 1` is the one word back.

- **AND THE GET-UP IS QUICKER (m97, `HURT.upBeat` 2.20 -> 1.55).** *"We need to make his get up
  animation quicker."* 2.708 s authored, so 2.20 was **x1.23** -- barely compressed, and it is the
  half of a knock-down you wait through rather than watch. x1.75 stands him up in 1.55 s and is
  still well inside the band m37's rule cares about. With m96's derived fall the whole knock-down
  is now **2.43 to 2.79 s** against m96's 3.08-3.44 and m90's 3.55.

- **THE CLIP HAS TO HAVE HIM ON THE FLOOR BEFORE HE GETS THERE, AND IT IS ONE MEASUREMENT AND ONE
  DIVISION (m96, `fallMark`, `HURT.mark`).** *"The thing that makes the warrior aliens look so
  good when they fly through the air is that when I blast them full, the animation is them laying
  on the ground BY THE TIME they hit the ground -- that's the key. The problem with mine is I
  either don't go far enough, don't have enough hang time, or the animation plays too slow. We
  could map the duration of the animation to the amount of hang time I get."*
  **HIS DIAGNOSIS IS ALL THREE AT ONCE AND THE ARITHMETIC AGREES WITH EVERY PART OF IT.** Measured
  off the Hips track of `take_damage_and_fall_down`:
      the clip puts him on the floor at **1.458 s** of its own time  (u 0.714 of 2.042 s)
      m90 played it at a FIXED x1.51, so the pose arrived at **0.964 s**
      the flight was **0.56 s**
      -> he landed **0.40 s before the animation did**, every single time
  **SO THE RATE IS SOLVED RATHER THAN TYPED**: `mark / (air * lead)`, where `air` is `2*vy/g` --
  the arc that was set two lines earlier -- and `lead` .92 is *"on the ground BEFORE you hit the
  ground"* said as a number. `HURT.beat` survives only as the fallback for a clip with no hips
  track, and nothing else reads it.
  **AND THE LANDMARK IS FOUND, NOT TRIMMED BY HAND** -- `flipMarks`' own method one clip over, so
  a re-export at any length moves it. **"Stays below the gate for ever" is the WRONG test** and it
  reported nothing at any threshold: this clip bottoms out at -1.11 and then SETTLES back up to
  +3.6, which is the body relaxing. First ARRIVAL within `gate` .08 of its own floor is the honest
  question, and it is stable across the band (.05 -> 1.500, .12 -> 1.375).
  **THE RATE FIX ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG, WHICH IS THE OTHER TWO THIRDS OF HIS SENTENCE.** At
  a 0.56 s hang the solve just plays the fall at x2.83 -- correct, and still a stumble. `hi`
  .78 -> **1.60** and `back` 7.6 -> **12**.
  **AND ONE ROLL DRIVES BOTH, SO A HARDER BLOW IS HIGHER *AND* FARTHER.** *"Sometimes they hit you
  and you go farther and sometimes shorter."* Two independent rolls give a high short launch and a
  low long one, which is nobody's idea of a harder hit -- and because the hang comes out of the
  same number, the CLIP follows it for free with nothing to keep in step:
      k      vy    apex    air    dist    rate    pose on the floor at
      .85   6.80   1.16   0.68    6.4    x2.33         0.63 s   <- before 0.68
      1.00  8.00   1.60   0.80    8.7    x1.98         0.74     <- before 0.80
      1.20  9.60   2.30   0.96   12.3    x1.65         0.88     <- before 0.96
      m90   5.59   0.78   0.56    4.0    x1.51         0.96     <- **0.40 LATE**
  Grounded before impact at every power, BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by two numbers being tuned
  toward each other. **And the whole knock-down got SHORTER** (3.08-3.44 s against 3.55) while
  going two to three times as far, because the fall no longer has to play out after he lands.
  **`rateMin`/`rateMax` ARE FITTED TO THE ONE HE SAYS LOOKS GOOD**, not picked: the warrior's own
  fall runs x1.6 to x2.5 (`downBeat` 1.5 on a 3.0 s clip, times `downVary`).
  **AND THE STATE READS THE LENGTH THE CLIP WAS SCALED BY** (`p.knockDur`), which is the m8
  landmine and is exactly what a per-launch rate walks into.

- **PUTTING A WEAPON AWAY IS THE SAME REACH, BACKWARDS (m96).** *"The animation for swapping
  weapons, when he goes from having a weapon to no weapon -- I think it's just playing in one
  direction for every switch, but for that one we should probably play it in reverse."* He is
  right and it was: there is ONE `weapon_swap` and it is a hand going INTO a bag and coming out
  with something. Forward it is a draw; backwards it is a stow.
  **A NEGATIVE `timeScale` IS THE OTHER DIRECTION** -- m89's rule for the wall shimmy, and it
  needs no second clip because only one direction is ever live at a time. **This is the first
  place it is used on a ONE-SHOT, and `reset()` is why that needed a line**: it puts the action at
  time 0, which is where a reversed clip FINISHES, so without starting it at the clip's end it
  clamps on its first frame and nothing moves. three's `LoopOnce` handles both ends of
  `_updateTime`, so `clampWhenFinished` holds frame 0 exactly as it holds the last one forward.
  **AND `SWAP.at` MIRRORS WITH IT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS.** Forward the weapon
  APPEARS when the hand comes back out at u .48; reversed the hand goes IN at `1 - .48`, and that
  is when it has to leave. Reading the same .48 either way drops the weapon out of his fist before
  the hand has got anywhere near the bag.
  **THE TEST IS THE TARGET, NOT THE PAIR.** `to` naming a slot with no `file` IS "to no weapon",
  which is his sentence exactly. Blaster -> hammer is a stow AND a draw and stays forward, because
  the reach that matters there is the one that ends holding something.

- **PICK HIM UP AND THROW HIM (m96, `GRAB`, `grabScan`, `grabRide`, `tossGo`, `bodyLaunch`).**
  *"You just pick him up by being within radius of him. The right stick -- there'll be a ring
  around it that's the colour of Clancy, so like orange, a rotating ring, and I know you won't be
  able to see that it's rotating unless there's pieces of it cut out. And a little icon of his
  face on the stick so it shows that you can tap to pick him up. You pull the stick up to wind up
  and then let go to release."*
  **NEARLY ALL OF IT WAS ALREADY BUILT, WHICH IS `d.K`'S DIVIDEND FOR THE EIGHTH TIME.** A thrown
  body is a body with a velocity: `bodyFly` is the integrator (the arc, the wall bounce, the
  ground stop, the landing thump), `FLYHIT` (m63) makes him bowl over whoever he lands on, and his
  own `falling_to_roll` / `cover_to_stand` have been wired as a knock-down since m73. **So the
  throw is `bodyLaunch` -- the same function a mace calls -- and what is actually new is the
  CARRY.** Every throw clears `FLYHIT.at` 6, so he is a skittle at any wind-up:
      wind  0.00   9.0 m/s out, 3.2 up   0.32 s of air    2.4 m
      wind  0.50  16.5          5.3      0.53             6.5
      wind  1.00  24.0          7.5      0.75            11.9
  **`bodyLaunch` IS AN EXTRACTION AND THAT IS THE POINT.** The tumble, the whoosh, the fall clip,
  the per-body beat and the two get-up rolls are what a body leaving the ground IS -- they were
  inline in `dummyBlow`, and a second caller is exactly when that stops being acceptable.
  **AND THE GESTURE COST NOTHING, BECAUSE A PROMPT IS WHAT MAKES A TAP MEAN SOMETHING ELSE.** The
  right pad's tap is the jump; while the ring is lit it is the pick-up instead, and that is not a
  hidden mode because **the ring and the glyph ARE the state** (m52's own answer to m36). Carrying,
  the up-hold is the wind-up rather than the trigger -- free, because a man with his hands full is
  not aiming -- and it is `padUp`'s same four gates, shared rather than re-derived (m46).
  **THE PROMPT IS DRAWN ON THE CONTROL THAT PERFORMS IT**, which is `actB`'s lesson one repo over:
  a prompt on the pad cannot be somewhere the thumb is not, and it costs no HUD element in the
  play area. Centred on the pad's OWN insets, the way `#modeRow` is, so it cannot drift off on a
  notched phone; inside `#padR::after`'s radius so the aim ring and it never overlap (they cannot
  both be live anyway). **The cut-outs are the whole point** -- a solid ring turning is a ring
  standing still -- and the spin is a CSS keyframe, so it runs on the compositor and the loop
  writes one class and two custom properties.
  **THE WIND-UP IS A RING THAT CLOSES IN, NOT A BAR**, the reticle's rule: how loaded something is
  should be a SHAPE you can read without looking away from the fight.
  **THE CARRY IS A `SPLIT.up` POSE AND THE THROW IS TOO.** `hold_item` is 3.333 s with five
  degrees of drift across the whole of it -- a held pose -- so it goes over the gait's `__legs`
  and he walks about with somebody in his arms, which is `weapon_swap`'s own shape (m91). The
  throw is the same, which keeps him mobile: being unable to move is the least fun state in any
  game, and this file says so twice already. **Three things now want the top half, so they are ONE
  override with a priority** rather than three branches each having to know about the other two.
  **HE IS WRITTEN TO THE PLAYER'S HANDS EVERY FRAME, NOT PARENTED TO A BONE.** The armature is
  scaled 0.01 and a child of it comes out at a hundredth of its size, which is m26's weapon lesson
  -- and this needs no bone anyway, because it is a position and a facing.
  **AND A CARRIED BODY IS OUT OF `bodySep` AND `pushBodies`.** Without that he is a solid in the
  player's own resolver being held 32 cm in front of the player's chest, which pushes him
  backwards every frame and reads as walking into an invisible box.
  **`lift` AND `tint` ARE ON THE KIND**, m38's empty-field pattern: the orcs, the drunks, the
  skater and the officer never reach any of it, and a second pal tomorrow brings his own colour
  with nothing typed in the HUD.
  **A FUMBLE IS NOT A THROW** (`minWind`) -- a stray brush of the top of the pad must not launch
  him, which is `WEAP.minChg`'s argument one verb over. And the charge is BANKED at the release
  (`p.tossK`), because the clip fires the launch `GRAB.at` of the way through and the thumb is
  long gone by then: the picture and its consequence have to be ONE event.
  **AND HE IS SET DOWN RATHER THAN DROPPED THROUGH THE FLOOR** wherever the carry ends for a
  reason that is not a throw -- a knock-down, a roll, latching to a wall.
  **STATED GAPS.** `GRAB.at` .38 is a **guess**, the taunt beats' own position (m65): a strike has
  an authored contact frame and a throw does not, and nothing in this container can pose a skin --
  so the chip reports `TOSS<t>` and `mel.GRAB.at` is the dial. **The face is a STAND-IN and is
  marked as one**: there is no artwork for him in this repo, so it is a drawn mark in his colour,
  and a PNG is what replaces it. The WEAPON MODEL is still in his hand while he carries somebody,
  which is odd and is not fixed here. There is **no desktop binding** -- m79 spends the left
  button on melee and right click on the kit cycle, so the pick-up wants a key and it is his call
  which. And **no gate in this repo executes `stepGrab`**: `check:syntax` parses and `check:boot`
  stops at `init()`, so the whole state machine is a device question. Every symbol it names was
  checked to exist, which is reading rather than running and is not the same thing.

- **A RE-EXPORT RENAMED A CLIP AND TOOK A WHOLE FEATURE WITH IT (m95, `backflip`).** *"I pushed a
  new zap model, new animations, way more melees, I put in a hold item and throw, I put in a block
  and block react."* One file, replaced in place: 45 clips to 54, and **`Backflip` came back as
  `backflip`**. It is a NAME in three places and `CLIPS.flipBack` was still spelling it the old
  way, so the backflip, the charged duck and the whole of m87 were **gone** the moment he pushed.
  **AND THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE SAID SO IS ONE WORD IN THE CHIP.** `NO CLIP Backflip`,
  which is m88's table check doing its job -- and *"the backflip stopped working"* and *"the
  backflip never worked"* are one picture from a phone. **Read the export before playing it.**
  **AND THREE OF THE FOUR MOVES ARE RENAMES, MATCHED BY DATA RATHER THAN BY NAME** -- m86's rule,
  per-bone rotation travel against the old file, and the second time it has paid here:
      backflip         == old `Backflip`          cos **1.0000**  (next best .9585)
      melee_extra      == old `melee_01`          cos **1.0000**  (next best .8499)
      weapon_melee_02  == old `weapon_melee_01`   cos **1.0000**  (next best .8928)
      melee_01         genuinely NEW -- best match .9496, which is nothing
      weapon_melee_01  genuinely NEW -- best match .9301
      the old `weapon_melee_02` (1.667 s, hips .156) is simply GONE
  Duration, key count, moving-bone count and hips travel all agree to the digit on each pair.
  **`MELEE.clip`'s 360 OVERRIDE STILL POINTS AT THE SAME ANIMATION** (`weapon_melee_04`, 1.0000
  with itself), so m94's numbers survived the re-export -- checked, not assumed.

- **`hurricane_kick` IS BROKEN IN THE EXPORT AND IS NOT WIRED (m95).** 62 rotation channels and
  **61 of them have ZERO travel**: only `mixamorig_Hips` moves, 1440 degrees of it. That is a man
  in a fixed pose rotating about his hips, not a kick. `npm run clips` flags it as **1 moving
  bone** against 44 on every other melee, which is the tell -- and it is the one case where a
  metric that asks *"does this track change"* is exactly the right question, because the answer
  is no on every limb. Nothing else in the file has it. **It wants a re-export; wiring it would
  put a spinning statue in the chain.**

- **THE CHAIN IS A LENGTH AND THE CLIPS ARE DEALT OUT OF A POOL (m95, `MELEE.links`,
  `p.meleeRoll`).** *"way more melees"* -- six unarmed now and four armed. Letting the chain BE
  the pool is the obvious move and it is wrong twice over: six links at a readable rate is about
  five seconds of watching, which is m36's *"a chain is not a film"*; and `power` is graded across
  the chain, so a six-link chain puts a man over on every SIXTH blow where today it is every
  third. **The tempo and the strength belong to the CHAIN; the clips belong to the POOL.**
  Three links, dealt in order, advanced by a WHOLE chain each time -- so consecutive chains share
  no clip and nothing comes round again until the pool is spent. Six unarmed clips are exactly
  two chains; four armed ones walk round every time:
      CHAIN 1  melee_01 melee_02 melee_03      2.93 s      ARMED 1  01 02 03
      CHAIN 2  melee_04 melee_05 melee_extra   2.29 s      ARMED 2  04 01 02
  **Advancing by ONE would make the second and third blows of a chain the first and second of the
  next**, which reads as repetition rather than as variety.
  **AND THE SEED IS NEGATIVE, SO THE DEAL IS NORMALISED.** `meleeRoll` starts at `-MELEE.links` so
  the first fresh chain advances onto clip 0 rather than past it, and JS `%` keeps the sign -- a
  bare `pool[(roll + ix) % len]` is `pool[-1]`, which is `undefined`, which is `NO CLIP undefined`.

- **THE BEAT COMES OFF THE CLIP'S OWN LENGTH (m95, `MELEE.rate`, `melBeat`).** m94 wrote the
  sentence -- *a beat belongs to the clip, not to a chain position* -- and typed ONE entry for the
  360. With ten melee clips, typing ten is a constant somebody has to remember, which is not a
  mechanism. `MELEE.clip` stays as the override; everything else is `duration / rate`.
  **AND `rate` IS FITTED TO THE BAND THE SHIPPED CLIPS ARE ALREADY JUDGED AT, NOT PICKED.** Today
  `melee_extra` runs at x1.55 and `melee_03` at x2.02; m36 threw out 3x as *"a blur with no pose
  in it"*; m94 chose x1.37 for the 360 because x2.13 was *"slow that one down"*. So the honest
  window is about 1.4 to 2.0 and 1.75 is the middle of it.
  **THE NUMBER TO WATCH IS THE CHAIN'S LENGTH IN SECONDS, AND IT IS WHY 1.5 WAS WRONG.** My first
  pass used 1.5 and a three-punch chain came to **3.24 s** -- longer than the 2.3 s m36 threw out
  as watching rather than playing, because his new clips are long (2.208 s and 1.917 s against the
  old pool's 0.958). Caught by running the arithmetic before shipping it, not by reading it.
  **`melee_01` IS TWICE THE LENGTH OF ANYTHING ELSE IN THE POOL**, and whether it reads as an
  OPENER is a device question -- nothing in this container can pose a skin. Moving it down the
  pool is one edit if it turns out to be the heavy one.

- **AND `power` WAS A THREE-SLOT ARRAY ON A CHAIN THAT HAD ALREADY OUTGROWN IT (m95, `melPower`).**
  It was read `[Math.min(ix, len - 1)]` exactly as `beat` and `lunge` were before m94 -- so every
  link past the third inherited the finisher's 1.0, and 1.0 clears every kind's `fling`, which is
  a LAUNCH. **That was already live and nobody had looked**: the armed pool has been four long
  since m86, so links 3 AND 4 have both been finishers for nine builds. At six unarmed it would
  have been four of them, and the chain would never once have reached link 5.
  **THE FINISHER IS THE LAST BLOW, WHICH IS A FACT ABOUT POSITION RELATIVE TO LENGTH**, so the
  three entries are read as what they are -- open / build / finish -- and everything between the
  first and the last is graded. **It is a NO-OP on a three-link chain**, which is the check that
  says it cannot have disturbed what is already tuned:
      n = 3   .450  .520  1.000          <- byte for byte the old array
      n = 6   .450  .468  .485  .503  .520  1.000
  and every real `fling` is .55 or over, so only the last one puts a man over.

- **THE GUARD HAS A CLIP, AND THE LINE WRITTEN FOR IT WAS THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE BROKEN IT
  (m95, `CLIPS.block`).** *"I put in a block and block react."* m37 wrote `CLIPS.block: ''` as a
  hook and this is what it was for -- `weapon_block` is a held pose (1.833 s, 20 degrees of drift)
  and `weapon_block_reaction` is a real react (left arm and forearm absorbing, 162 and 153 of
  travel). Naming them is nearly the whole change. **Nearly.**
  **A LINE SAT IN `rigAnim` THAT PLAYED THE BLOCK CLIP WHOLE AND RETURNED** -- written when the
  name was empty, so it could never fire, so it cost nothing and looked right. The moment the clip
  landed it would have short-circuited the committed branch sixty lines down, which is the one
  built for exactly this: a `SPLIT.up` pose over strafing `__legs`. What that gets you is a statue
  sliding sideways, with the good path sitting right there unreachable. **m19's shape -- two
  places answering one question, and the one that runs is the worse one.**
  **A BRANCH THAT CANNOT FIRE YET IS NOT A BRANCH THAT WORKS**, and naming a clip is exactly when
  it stops being free. The line is gone and `'block'` is in `SPLIT.up`, so the guard composes the
  way every other committed pose does.
  **`HURT.hits` IS THE REACT NOW, AND m91 SAID IT WOULD BE.** With `FOE.knock` at 1 every
  unblocked blow launches him, so `hits` is ONLY ever reached through a raised guard -- which
  means a guard react is literally what that field is. `stagger` .80 -> **.95**, because the clip
  is 1.333 s and .80 is x1.67: m37's rule, a blow too fast to read is the same blow every time.
  The two `take_damage_*` clips stay in the file and are one word from coming back.
  **AND IT IS THE ARMED PAIR STANDING IN FOR THE UNARMED GUARD.** There is one block clip and one
  react, and a man with his fists up is not a man with a hammer up -- but a guard that reads
  slightly wrong beats a guard that reads as the idle, which is what he had. Drawing an unarmed
  pair is two strings and no branch.

- **THE CHIP SAYS WHICH CLIP, NOT ONLY WHICH LINK (m95).** The chain is dealt out of a pool now,
  so the link number no longer identifies the animation -- and *"that one connects at the wrong
  part of the swing"* is a sentence about a CLIP. `melee2/05@0.62!` is link two, playing
  `melee_05`, blow fired at u 0.62, connected. m94's `@u` half and this half together turn a
  report about an animation into two numbers.

- **NOT DONE, AND EACH FOR A REASON (m95).** `hold_item` (3.333 s, 5 degrees of drift -- a HELD
  pose) and `throw_item` (2.042 s, right arm leading at 487 of travel -- a real throw) are a new
  VERB PAIR, and there is no item in this game to hold or throw: no pickup, no carried entity, no
  slot for one. **That is a build, not a rider on this one**, and the open question is the
  GESTURE -- the control map is full (left pad the body, right pad the verb; tap, hold, flick and
  drag all spent), so the honest candidates are a left-pad hold-in-place, which is the one
  unassigned thing on either pad, or a kit slot. `driving` (5.000 s, 8 bones, 13 degrees) is a
  seated pose with no vehicle, and `hurricane_kick` is broken at source, above.

- **A BLOW YOU CAN SEE LAND, AND THE SWEEP HAD KNOWN EXACTLY WHERE SINCE m20 (m94, `MFX`,
  `meleeHit`, the limb trail).** *"The sound adds a lot to the illusion of melee connection, but
  with the sound off, when I'm swinging my gun on the melee stick it doesn't feel like you're
  connecting with them visually -- there's something missing. There needs to be something where
  the collider connects with the character and there's a physical visual aid at the connection
  point, because right now it just does not feel or look like you're actually hitting anything.
  And I want the slashes on all of them no matter what you're holding: if he's punching it's the
  fist, if it's the hammer it's the tip of the hammer, if it's the gun it's part of the gun, if
  he's doing a kick it's his feet."*
  **HIS LIST IS ONE MECHANISM, AND IT WAS ALREADY BUILT.** m20's sweep tests a SEGMENT from each
  limb's last world position to this one -- both hands, both feet and the weapon's far end -- so
  *"the fist / the hammer tip / part of the gun / his feet"* is not four cases to write: **it is
  what the collider is already MADE of.** `segBody` solved the closest approach along that segment
  and returned a boolean; it fills `_hitP` now, on HIS SURFACE at the limb's own height rather
  than at the limb's centre, because a spark inside a man's chest is a glow and one on the face
  the blow came in by is an impact. **The blow and the mark it leaves cannot disagree about where
  they were, because there is one answer.**
  **AND THE MARK IS THREE THINGS, WHICH IS m39'S OWN SPLIT** -- a core FLASH that GROWS as it
  fades (one that only dims reads as a light being turned down; one that expands reads as
  something ARRIVING), a radial BURST that says how hard, and **the body lighting up**, which is
  what makes it something happening TO him rather than particles that happened nearby. That last
  one is m71's own stated gap: *"a melee hit does not flash the body -- `bodyFlash` is called
  from exactly one place, the bolt's impact swarm, so a shot lights the mesh up and a punch does
  not. One line in `dummyBlow` would do it, and it is left out here so the kickback can be judged
  on its own."* This is the build it belongs to, and it went where the CONTACT is rather than in
  `dummyBlow`, so it lands with the spark instead of a frame apart from it.
  **THE WHOLE THING SCALES WITH `power`**, so a jab sparks and the finisher is an event -- the
  ball's own rule (m36), where one number drives the picture and the consequence together.
- **AND THE SLASH IS THE LIMB'S OWN PATH, NOT A CARD (m94, `MFX.trail`).** Shredworld draws a
  camera-facing sprite for this and spent **three builds** on its orientation alone -- c91 built
  it as a `Sprite`, c153 rolled it to the blow's screen angle, c160 found that *"a billboard is
  camera-facing BY DEFINITION, so every fix after it was choosing which way a flat sticker lay on
  the GLASS"* and had to lay it flat in the world instead.
  **THERE IS NOTHING TO ORIENT HERE.** Sparks dropped along `q -> _sw` with no velocity and a
  0.12 s life ARE the arc the weapon actually swept, in the world, from whichever limb swept it
  -- which is the bolt's own streak (m39) pointed at a fist. It is right by construction for
  every weapon, every clip and every clip not drawn yet, it needs no per-clip constant, and **it
  costs no second draw call because the pool is one.**
  **IT FOLLOWS THE FASTEST LIMB AND ONLY THAT ONE.** Every bone over a threshold is four streaks
  and a smear; a slash is ONE stroke, and the limb doing the striking is by definition the one
  moving quickest through his own frame -- a number the sweep computes per bone anyway. **So the
  speed test moved OUT of the window**: `MFX.swing` .8 is well under `STRIKE.swing` 2.4, because
  a trail that only appeared once a blow could count would start half way through the swing it is
  drawing.
  **AND A FLASH CARRIES ITS OWN STACK NOW.** `stepFlashes` had `[2.6, 4.2, 6.4]` written into it
  as a literal -- the BOLT's three sprites -- so a fist landing would have been drawn at the
  plasma impact's proportions whatever size it asked for. A record names its own multipliers and
  the bolt's are the default: **a second producer reading the first one's constants is the same
  fault as two places answering one question**, one table down.
- **A BEAT, A CONTACT FRAME AND A LUNGE BELONG TO THE CLIP, NOT TO A CHAIN POSITION (m94,
  `MELEE.clip`, `clipOf`).** *"There's a spinning melee, and the actual arc of the spin where he's
  doing the attack -- they don't usually even react to it. It's like once he's settled and he kind
  of spins back, that's when they hit. I think we might need to slow that one down, and also we
  need to make sure the right part of that animation is connecting."*
  **`beat`, `at`, `lunge` AND `power` ARE ALL READ `[Math.min(ix, len - 1)]`**, which m86 wrote
  down as costing nothing -- *"a four-link chain needs nothing: the fourth link inherits the
  finisher's numbers"* -- and that is true of `power` and false of the other three the moment the
  fourth clip is not a fourth punch. `weapon_melee_04` is the renamed
  `Standing_Melee_Attack_360_High`, and a 360 is not a jab with a different index:
      beat    .82 on a **1.750 s** clip -> **x2.13**, which is his "slow that one down" exactly
      lunge   the finisher's 9.0, capped by `lungeMax` to **4.6 m of travel** -- a spin thrown
              ON THE SPOT was crossing four and a half metres mid-arc, so where he IS when the
              swing passes is different every time. That is a real candidate for the reaction
              not lining up with the arc, and it is stated as a candidate rather than as the
              diagnosis.
      at      .32, a fraction authored for a punch
  1.25 / .55 / 2.2 / 2.6, so the clip plays at **x1.40** and the spin covers about 1.6 m.
  **`at` .55 IS A GUESS AND IS MARKED AS ONE**, the taunt beats' rule (m65): a jab has an obvious
  contact frame and a full turn does not, and **nothing in this container can pose a skin** to
  measure one -- every character GLB is draco and `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker.
  **SO THE CHIP REPORTS THE `u` THE BLOW ACTUALLY FIRED AT.** `melee4@0.62!` -- `MELEE.at` says
  where the WINDOW OPENS and the sweep says where the limb actually ARRIVED, so a swing whose arc
  is at 0.45 and whose blow reads `@0.88` names its own fault, and *"it connects at the wrong part
  of the animation"* stops being a sentence and becomes a number. That is the honest shape of the
  half of this build I cannot measure from here.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** whether the spark reads as a connection, whether the trail reads
  as a slash or as fairy dust, and where in `weapon_melee_04` the arc really passes are all device
  questions for the reason above. `mel.MFX` is live (`trail = 0` and `on = 0` are the two A/Bs),
  and `mel.MELEE.clip` is the 360's four numbers.

- **THE TACKLE WAS SOLVED SHORT AND THEN COULD NOT CONNECT, AND BOTH ARE ONE WORD: IT IS NOT A
  SWING (m93, `MELEE.slideFree`, `STRIKE.bodyAt`/`bodyR`/`bodyFrom`).** *"When I'm running and I
  melee, if you're far away from an enemy he does a nice long slide tackle -- but when I'm closer
  to them it seems to cut it short, and it's also not hitting them very well. I've managed to hit
  them a little bit but most of the time I just slide a short distance to them and it doesn't even
  hurt them. Maybe we need to put bigger collide on his hands or feet."* Three faults, and his
  three sentences name them in order.
  **1. THE DISTANCE WAS THE MAN'S, NOT THE MOVE'S -- WHICH IS m51 DOING EXACTLY WHAT m51 IS FOR.**
  The lock inverts `v * dur * carryAvg` so a swing lands ON him, and that is why a man at arm's
  length gets a JAB thrown on the spot. Read straight off the shipped line:
      nobody in front   melV 9.00   travel **6.20 m**   <- the "nice long" one
      a man at 3 m      melV 3.27   travel **2.25 m**
      a man at 2 m      melV 1.81   travel **1.25 m**
      a man at 8 m      melV 10.53  travel  7.25 m
  **A jab on the spot is right and a SLIDE on the spot is not a slide.** So the solve may only
  ever LENGTHEN this one: the floor is its own `slideV` and the lock reaches further, never
  nearer. Sliding THROUGH him is what a slide tackle IS, and `hitAll` plus the swept limb already
  catch everybody he passes -- m43's own argument about the dash, one move over.
  **2. AND `STRIKE.swing` IS WHY IT BARELY CONNECTED.** That gate asks whether the limb is moving
  **in HIS OWN FRAME** -- the root's travel deliberately taken back out, which is the whole test
  for a swung arm against a carried one, and which m20 was right to build. `slide_kick` extends
  the leg ONCE and then holds it out while the body slides, so for nearly all of the move the
  boot's own-frame speed is near zero and **the sweep never counted at all.** `flying_kick` is the
  same shape: a held pose thrown across the air.
  **SO THE QUESTION BRANCHES RATHER THAN THE THRESHOLD MOVING** -- these two are the BODY
  arriving, which is m45's own sentence about the dash. `STRIKE.bodyAt` reads the ROOT's speed
  instead: live from u .08 to u **.87** of the tackle, which is nearly all of the travel, and it
  shuts by itself as the bleed runs out, which is the slide ending.
  **3. AND THE CONTACT IS HIS LEG, NOT HIS KNUCKLE**, which is the "bigger collide" he asked for.
  `STRIKE.r` is 18.6 cm on a 1.25 m body; `bodyR` is 44 cm -- and **because the sweep is a SPHERE,
  the same number widens the HEIGHT margin**, which is what lets a kick thrown from above reach a
  man's head. One constant, all three axes, by construction rather than as a special case.
  **AND A BODY MOVE'S WINDOW STAYS LIVE RATHER THAN CLOSING ON THE FIRST MAN.** `p.melFired` gates
  an ordinary strike to one connect, which is right for a swing and wrong for a six-metre slide
  through a line of men -- `d.cool` already stops any one of them being hit twice, so he takes
  them one at a time as he reaches each.
  **IT TRIPS THEM NOW (`slidePow` .78).** *"I'm thinking I'm gonna maybe have it trip them and
  have them fall over -- at very least it should deliver some damage."* It took `power[0]` .45,
  under every kind's `fling` (.70 on the warrior, .55 on the rest), so it could only ever stagger.
  .78 clears all of them and `dummyBlow` grades the launch from `fly0` across `fling..1` SQUARED:
      warrior   k .489  ->  **11.7 m/s out, 4.2 up**   against the finisher's 24 / 8.5
      the drunks and the skater  k .594  ->  15.4 out   -- a skinny man goes further, which is right
  **AND THE DAMAGE STAYS MODEST, WHICH IS HIS OWN SENTENCE.** *"Maybe a disarmed melee is just not
  that strong, which it probably shouldn't be."* `slideDmg` 1.1 against a fist's .8 and the
  finisher's 3.2 -- it costs more than a punch because you had to run at him for it.
- **AND THE FLYING KICK HAD NO LOCK AT ALL (m93, `MELEE.airMax`).** *"I want the flying kick to
  sort of aim assist -- even if you're up in the air and you're a little bit above them, if you
  flick the melee stick more or less towards them I want it to target them and I want to hit
  them."* `kickGo` set `p.melTgt = null` and never called `meleeLock`, so **the one move thrown
  from furthest away was the one with no assist on it.**
  **IT NEEDED NO VERTICAL TERM, WHICH IS WORTH SAYING BECAUSE IT IS THE OBVIOUS THING TO ADD.**
  `aimAt` is purely horizontal, so being above him does not change his bearing and the cone was
  never the problem up there. What was missing is the SWEEP's own height margin, and `bodyR`
  widens it as a side effect of being a sphere.
  Same reach-is-what-it-delivers rule as everything else here (m20, m72): the acquire radius is
  `airMax + arrive`, so a man past what the kick can cover is refused rather than aimed at and
  fallen short of -- and the solve is a FLOOR here too, doubly so, because a kick that shortens
  itself lands him on the floor beside the man. Floor 5.85 m, out to 8.50 at the acquire edge.
  **AND THE CHIP CARRIES THE TRAVEL** (`TACKLE6.2!`, `KICK5.9`). *"It seems to cut it short"* is a
  MEASUREMENT, and it is the one thing that tells "the solve shortened it" from "it travelled and
  went through him" apart from a phone. `!` is still the connect.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin, so whether a 44 cm
  sweep radius reads as generous or as a phantom hit, and whether 6.2 m is the right floor for a
  slide, are device questions. The arithmetic -- the travels, the windows, the launch `k` and the
  damage -- is above and was. `mel.MELEE.slideFree = 0` is the one word back to m88, and
  `mel.STRIKE.bodyR` / `mel.MELEE.slidePow` are the two dials.

- **THE BACKFLIP LAUNCHED ON THE FRAME OF THE RELEASE AND THE CLIP LEAVES THE GROUND A THIRD OF
  A SECOND LATER (m92, `flipMarks`'s `off`, `p.bkHang`).** *"The backflip charge is cool and works
  mostly right. The problem is when you release to do the backflip, the upward velocity starts way
  before the backflip animation gets to its jump point. So I'm not sure how to rectify that --
  either speed up the backflip, or have him freeze frame later in the sequence, or something."*
  **HE IS DESCRIBING A MEASUREMENT AND IT COMES STRAIGHT OFF THE HIPS.** m87 found three landmarks
  in a flip clip -- the crouch, the apex and the landing -- and the one it did not look for is the
  one that matters here: **a standing flip does not leave the ground at the bottom of its crouch,
  it PUSHES first, and that push happens on the FLOOR.**
      Backflip     standing hips 38.4   crouch t+0.000 (28.3)   TAKE-OFF t+0.333 (38.5)
                                        apex   t+0.500 (45.4)   landing  t+1.125 (31.9)
      front_flip   standing hips 33.4   crouch t+0.000          TAKE-OFF t+0.000
  So m87 had him **rising through 0.333 s of leg extension -- 29% of the smallest flip's entire
  airtime.** `front_flip` reads 0.000 and leaves on its first frame, which is why the air double
  was already right and is byte-for-byte unchanged by this.
  **THE TAKE-OFF NEEDS NO THRESHOLD EITHER**, which is what lets one function serve both clips: it
  is the first key at or after the crouch where the hips are back to the height they were STANDING
  at (key 0), because that is where his legs have finished extending. On a clip with no wind-up
  the crouch IS key 0 and it comes out zero with no case of its own -- the same shape as `from`.
  **AND OF HIS THREE SUGGESTIONS THE ANSWER IS THE FOURTH ONE: HOLD HIM DOWN FOR THE PUSH.**
  Speeding the clip up makes the rotation wrong everywhere else; freezing later loses the push
  entirely and snaps the held crouch straight into mid-air, which is a jump cut. Holding him on
  the floor for exactly `off` and launching at the end of it makes **the clip and the physics
  agree BY CONSTRUCTION** rather than by two numbers being tuned toward each other.
  **IT IS NOT LATENCY, IT IS THE PUSH** -- `SLAM.hang`'s own argument, and unlike that one this
  is MEASURED off the clip rather than typed, so a re-export moves it.
      charge 0.00   apex 3.40 m   airtime 1.17s   rate x1.12   push 0.30s
      charge 1.00   apex 6.80 m   airtime 1.65s   rate x1.00   push 0.33s
  **THREE THINGS HAD TO MOVE WITH IT, AND EACH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BUG.**
  1. **`rigAnim`'s flip branch moved ABOVE the air test.** The first third of a second is spent
     ON THE FLOOR, so below it the gait takes that half and the flip only appears once he has
     already left -- which is the fault this build exists to remove, moved one frame later.
  2. **`p.flip`'s clear could not read `grounded` alone.** During the hang he is deliberately on
     the floor with the flip clip running, and `|| p.grounded` kills it on the first frame.
  3. **`flipDur` covers the push as well as the air.** Started at the launch, the clip's push
     half plays under a table not asking for it and the rotation is cut short by exactly `off`.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `PUSH0.28`** between `DUCK` and `FLIPback`, so the three beats of the move each
  name themselves -- "it never launched", "it launched early" and "the rotation is wrong" are
  three bugs and one picture from a phone.

- **HE REACHES INTO HIS BACKPACK, AND IT IS AN UPPER-BODY OVERRIDE OVER THE ORDINARY GAIT (m91,
  `SWAP`, `swapGo`, `applySlot`).** *"I now have an animation where he reaches into his backpack,
  so we need to use this every time he swaps weapons or takes one out or puts one away."*
  **A REACH IS SOMETHING YOU DO WHILE WALKING, so it must not own the body.** Every other
  one-shot here does -- a strike, a roll, a slam -- and each of those is a move you deliberately
  spend. A kit change is a TAP on the left pad, and half a second of not being able to move in a
  fight because you changed weapons is the wrong trade. So `weapon_swap` goes into `SPLIT.up` and
  the four gait clips drop to their `__legs` halves underneath it: **between them every bone is
  claimed exactly once, so they COMPOSE rather than average.**
  **THE TWO AT FULL `rest` SUMMING TO 2 IS CORRECT HERE AND ONLY HERE**, which is worth saying
  out loud next to this file's standing "the table must sum to 1" rule: that rule is about clips
  that claim the SAME bones, and these two are disjoint by construction. The committed branch has
  done the same thing since m19 for the same reason. **Averaging two clips that both key an arm
  gives a shrug**, and m19 is the build that paid for it.
  **AND THE WEAPON ARRIVES PART-WAY THROUGH THE REACH, NOT ON THE FRAME OF THE TAP** (`SWAP.at`).
  `MELEE.at`'s rule: the picture and its consequence have to be ONE event, and a weapon that pops
  into his hand on the input frame makes the whole animation a thing that happens afterwards for
  no reason. `applySlot` is the old `cycleKit` body, deferred -- and fired on the CROSSING rather
  than every frame past it, which is `p.gotUp`'s own shape one state over.
  **`.48` IS A GUESS AND IS MARKED AS ONE**, the taunt beats' own position (m65): a strike has an
  authored contact frame to measure against and a reach does not. `mel.SWAP.at` is the dial.
  **IT FALLS STRAIGHT THROUGH IF THE CLIP IS NOT THERE** -- `swapGo` applies the slot instantly
  and returns 0 -- so there is no branch to add the day it is re-exported under another name and
  none to remove if it goes. `CLIPS.block`'s pattern.
  **AND ANYTHING THAT OWNS THE BODY CANCELS IT, TAKING THE WEAPON WITH IT** (`swapStop`): a punch
  thrown mid-reach is the arms doing two things, and a swap you have to wait out is a swap nobody
  uses in a fight. The five callers are `meleeGo`, `rollGo`, `slamGo`, `wallGo` and the
  knock-down -- **and every one of them DELIVERS the slot rather than discarding it**, because the
  input was given and losing it to a collision is a tap that did nothing.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `SWAP0.31` THEN `SWAP✓`**, because "the reach never played", "it played and the
  weapon was already in his hand" and "it played and the weapon never arrived" are three bugs with
  one picture from a phone, and the tick is the half only `swapDone` knows.
- **AND THE WARRIORS ALWAYS SEND HIM FLYING NOW (m91, `FOE.knock` .35 -> 1).** *"Let's just make
  it right now so that the warrior aliens send him flying if they hit me. Period, end of story.
  Unless I block it. But I don't have the animations yet, so they just send him flying. He lands
  on the ground and gets up."*
  **m88 MADE IT A CHANCE FOR A REAL REASON AND HE HAS ANSWERED IT.** That concern was that three
  seconds of floor per hit is "being unable to move is the least fun state in any game" taken to
  its conclusion -- and two things make it fine now: **the fall actually reads** (m90 put the fall
  clip on from the blow rather than blending into a held pose), and **`HURT.again` 1.1 is what
  keeps three orcs from holding him down**, since a blow inside that window still hurts and still
  shoves but does not re-launch. That stays, and it is the only deviation from "period, end of
  story" -- stated rather than quietly kept.
  **AND `HURT.hits` IS NOW ONLY REACHED THROUGH A BLOCK**, which is right and is where those two
  clips belong: a blocked blow is the one that leaves him on his feet, so `take_damage_head` and
  `take_damage_body` are the block reaction until there is a block clip drawn.

- **THE WARRIORS HAD THE RIGHT SEQUENCE ALL ALONG, AND IT IS ONE LINE OF `bodyAnim` (m90).**
  *"The warrior aliens fly through the air and land perfectly on the ground, and they're playing
  one of the same animations I have on Zap -- I named it something like take damage and fall
  down. The problem with our hero is when he's hit through the air and then eventually lands, the
  momentum already stops and he's not laying down, and then he blends to a lay position and it
  looks horrible."*
  **HE IS DESCRIBING A STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE, NOT A TUNING ONE, AND IT IS VISIBLE IN ONE LINE:**
      t[air && K.clips.air ? K.clips.air : d.cur] = 1;        // bodyAnim, line 7654
  **`FOE.clips` HAS NO `air` FIELD**, so a warrior plays his FALL clip (`Shoulder_Hit_And_Fall`)
  for the whole flight AND the landing -- one continuous animation started at the moment of the
  blow. That is the sequence he likes and it has been there since m35 without anybody writing
  down that the absence of a field is what makes it work.
  **m88 GAVE THE PLAYER THE OPPOSITE, IN BOTH HALVES.** `in_air` is a FLOAT LOOP, so the body
  looks static while it travels -- which is the *"momentum already stops"* -- and `laying_down`
  is ONE KEY. **A held pose is not an arrival**: nothing draws him going down, so the weight
  table drags him into the pose over a few frames, and that drag IS *"it blends to a lay
  position"*. There was never a fall in it at all.
  **SO THE FALL STARTS AT THE BLOW AND RUNS THROUGH THE GROUND.** `take_damage_and_fall_down`
  was sitting in the export unused since m85; it is `HURT.down` now, played from `playerHurt`
  rather than from the landing, and **the knock-down branch in `rigAnim` had to move ABOVE the
  air branch** -- left below it, `in_air` takes the whole flight and the fall only begins once he
  has already landed, which is precisely the shape being complained about.
  **AND THE CLOCK MOVED OFF `p.land` ONTO `p.knockT`.** The fall begins in the air, so a clock
  that starts at the landing is a clock that starts after most of what it is timing -- and a
  knock-down no longer enters a landing state at all, because a `landing_hard` on top of a fall
  clip is the second event that made the old one read as a blend. `HURT.land` is deleted rather
  than left: a constant nobody reads is indistinguishable from one that is broken.
      the flight     vy 5.59 m/s, 0.56 s, 3.96 m, arriving at 6.61 m/s
      the fall clip  2.042 s over a 1.35 s beat -> x1.51, and the flight is 41% of it, so the
                     rest is the landing -- the warrior's own shape (3.0 s over a 1.5 s beat)
      the get-up     2.708 s over 2.20 -> x1.23
      total down     3.55 s, against the warrior's 3.30
  **`laying_down` IS OUT OF THE SEQUENCE**, which is m41's rule (one fall and one get-up, so the
  pair cannot disagree) and this pair agrees: the fall ENDS lying down and `lay_to_get_up` STARTS
  lying down. `clampWhenFinished` holds the fall's last frame, so the lie is its own tail and
  needs no second clip. Naming it as a held tail is one word if the lie should ever outlast it.
  **AND A BODY ON THE FLOOR SCRUBS LIKE A BODY, NOT LIKE A MAN BRAKING (`HURT.skid`).** This is a
  second, separate bug found on the way and it is stated as one: the player's stop branch reads
  `MOVE.drag`, whose time constant is **2.11 s**, so landing at 6.61 m/s he had **13.9 m of
  slide** still to come, on his back. The warrior has had `knockDrag` 5.5 for exactly this since
  m37 and the player was simply reading the locomotion number. 5.5 is **1.20 m** and 0.18 s.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `FALL0.42` THEN `getup`**, because "the fall never played", "it played and the
  landing is wrong" and "the get-up is the bit that reads badly" are three bugs with one picture
  from a phone -- and the number is the clock both halves are cut from.

- **WALL COVER, AND THE WHOLE THING RESTS ON A FACT THIS GAME HAD NEVER ASKED FOR (m89, `WALL`,
  `wallFind`, `wallGo`, `stepWall`).** *"We have the animation from standing to wall. I only put
  in one standing-to-wall animation, so he'll always land in the equivalent of wall cover right --
  wall cover left and right are just him with his belly facing away from the wall, so he's
  flipped 180 back against it. Any sort of shimmy left and shimmy right. When you become close to
  a wall, if you're just pressing and holding the locomotion stick toward the wall, he'll
  naturally go into cover. You can use the locomotion stick to go left and go right, and then if
  you push away from the wall -- we'll have a little bit of a grace period for the moving left and
  right, and you really have to press directly away from the wall to get off of it. Or jump."*
  **WHERE IS A WALL AND WHICH WAY DOES IT FACE.** `resolveBoxes` pushes him OUT of things and
  `groundAt` reads tops; nothing here has ever been able to name a FACE. `BOXES` is axis-aligned
  -- m24 keeps every placement on a quarter turn for exactly this class of reason -- so **the
  closest point on a box's FOOTPRINT gives the distance to the face AND its outward normal in one
  step**: `clamp` per axis, then the vector from that point to him. No per-face tests, right
  whichever side he comes at, and **being INSIDE the footprint returns nothing**, which is what
  stops him latching onto the roof he is standing on. Shredworld's `ledgeGrab` rule, and **the
  LEDGE build wants this same function** -- which is the real reason this one went first.
  **NO BUTTON AND NO SECOND GESTURE.** The thumb that walks him at a wall is the thumb that
  latches him to it, which is why `into` is a DOT and not a distance: running ALONG a wall does
  not stick to it and walking AT it does.
  **AND LETTING GO IS A HOLD, NOT A FRAME.** `off` .62 is deliberately harder than `into` .45 --
  *"you really have to press directly away"* -- and `grace` .30 is the clock on top, which is
  what lets a diagonal shimmy overshoot for a moment without dropping him. The jump is tested
  FIRST, because it is the one exit that must never be eaten by the grace period.
  **FOUR OF THE NUMBERS SCALE WITH HIM (m52's rule) AND ONE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.** How tall a
  thing has to be to hide you, where your chest is, how far your back sits off a wall and how
  close is close enough are all facts about his BODY -- and a typed 1.2 m is cover for a 1.75 m
  man and a wall a 1.25 m man cannot use. Measured over the test site, `SZ` .714:
      tall 0.857   chest 0.679   latch 0.636 m off the face   standoff 0.457 m
      typed        6 of 10 boxes were cover
      x SZ         **8 of 10** -- the 1.15 m and the 1.00 m blocks come in, and both are over
                   his chest, which is what cover MEANS. The 0.40 and 0.35 kerbs stay out.
      the 14 x 1.2 m slab at (0,-18) is 9.3 s of shimmy end to end at `speed` 1.5
  `speed` is NOT scaled: m53 is the build where he chose to keep his world speed at a smaller size.
  **THE SHIMMY RE-FINDS THE FACE EVERY FRAME RATHER THAN CLAMPING TO THE LATCHED BOX**, because a
  building's wall is a RUN of merged column boxes (m34) and sliding along it has to carry across
  them. A face whose normal disagrees with the one he latched is a DIFFERENT wall, so at the end
  of a run there is nothing to find and he simply stops -- which IS the end of the cover, with no
  edge test written. And the move is the stick's component ALONG the face and nothing else, so
  pushing into the wall does nothing and a diagonal is just its sideways part.
  **THE ENTRY CLIP'S LAST FRAME IS THE COVER IDLE, FOR FREE.** `clampWhenFinished` holds it, so a
  pose nobody drew costs nothing and the shimmy blends over it and back. And the entry animates
  IN PLACE (hips XZ 0.000 on all five wall clips), so **the STEP to the wall is code** -- he is
  lerped onto the standoff across `inDur`, which is what makes it read as an approach rather than
  as a snap with an animation over it.
  **AND THERE IS NO UNARMED `wall_cover_move_right`, SO IT IS THE LEFT ONE PLAYED BACKWARDS.** A
  shimmy is a symmetrical slide, so a negative `timeScale` IS the other direction -- and unlike
  Shredworld's `aimBack` this needs **no clone**, because only one direction is ever live at a
  time and there is nothing to weight against itself. The RIFLE set has both drawn and uses them,
  picked off `slotNow().aim`.
  **`+side` IS HIS RIGHT, AND THE SIGN CANNOT DISAGREE WITH THE MOTION** because the clip picker
  and the move read the same tangent: he faces along the normal, his right is `(-fz, fx)`, and
  with `f = (nx, nz)` that is `(-nz, nx)`.
  **THE TWO TRANSITIONS ARE IN `ONCE` AND THE TWO SHIMMIES MUST NOT BE** -- a looped stand-up is
  a man getting up for ever, and a one-shot shimmy stops after one cycle.
  **STATED GAPS.** `WALL.ref` 1.2 is a **guess, not a measurement**: the shimmy clip animates in
  place, so there is no authored travel to read the way `npm run gait` reads a walk, and `mel.WALL
  .ref` is the dial if his feet slide. There is **no desktop binding needed** (this is the LEFT
  pad, which the keys already drive) but **no corner turn**: he stops at the end of a face rather
  than rounding it, which is honest and is what the clips support. And nothing in this container
  can build a skin, so whether the entry reads at x1.9 and whether the belly-out pose lines up
  with the face are device questions -- `mel.WALL` is live. The chip says
  `WALL(down/up/left/right/dot)`.

- **THREE OF HIS FOUR ASKS WERE ALREADY MACHINERY WITH EMPTY HOOKS (m88).** *"That slide tackle
  can now be if you're running and you melee -- it becomes the first link in the melee sequence,
  but I want it to only trigger if you've actually got a few steps in, not just if you're holding
  a direction. Flying kick is if you jumped in the air and you melee. I want the orcs to hit me
  and me to play the take damage animation, but I also want them to be able to swing and send me
  flying... when I get sent through the air I don't land on my feet, I always land on my back
  laying down and then I get up."*
  **NOT ONE OF THEM NEEDED A NEW STATE**, which is the whole return on `p.melee` being a clip, a
  beat and a solved velocity rather than three hard-coded moves, and on m67 writing `HURT.down`
  and `HURT.up` as `''` and running the states regardless.
      the tackle      a strike with `slide_kick`, `slideDur` and `slideV`
      the flying kick a strike with `flying_kick`, `airDur` and `airV`, ended by the GROUND
      being hit       `HURT.hits` named; `down`/`up` filled
  **"A FEW STEPS IN" IS `p.runT`, AND `p.goT` IS EXACTLY THE THING HE RULED OUT.** `goT` is how
  long he has been ASKING to move -- a thumb held -- which is his own sentence for what must not
  trigger it. `runT` is how long he has actually BEEN over `slideAt`, and it is read from LAST
  frame's speed, which is the right one: the question is whether he ARRIVED at this flick
  running. At 4.2 m/s a stride is about 1.3 m, so `slideT` .45 is three of them.
  **AND IT IS AN OPENING, NOT A FOURTH STRIKE** -- running at somebody and hitting melee is one
  move, not two decisions. `p.meleeIx` stays 0, so the next flick takes link two and the chain
  reads on from it exactly as it would have. It gets its own `slideMax` 7.5 m because
  `lungeMax` 4.6 is the cap for a standing lunge and a tackle is supposed to cross ground.
  **THE FLYING KICK ENDS WHEN HE MEETS THE GROUND, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF EVERY OTHER
  STRIKE** -- they all end when he LEAVES it -- so that test BRANCHES rather than gaining a
  clause, `slamGo`'s own rule. `p.meleeT > .1` is what stops it cancelling on the frame it
  began, because he can be one frame off the floor when it fires. It keeps its drive in the air
  for `chargeGo`'s reason (there is no ground to scrub against, and a kick that bleeds to
  nothing mid-flight drops straight down), and **it does not touch `vel.y`**: he is already
  ballistic, and driving the vertical would make it a second slam. One per airtime
  (`p.airKick`, cleared beside `p.jumps`), or it is a flutter kick across the street.
  **`FOE.knock` IS A CHANCE NOW, NOT A FLAG.** *"Maybe like a few swings -- I'm not sure if they
  have a big swing versus a small swing; if they don't, that's fine, we can just have it be
  random."* There is one swing pool and no big/small in the export, so **the variety is in what
  the blow DOES rather than in which clip threw it**. At 1 every mace hit put him on his back,
  and with the lie and the get-up that is nearly three seconds of floor per blow -- which is
  "being unable to move is the least fun state in any game" taken to its conclusion. At .35 most
  swings stagger and about a third launch. `mel.hurt()` passes 1 and still always launches.
  **A ONE-KEY CLIP IS A POSE, AND `normaliseClips` WAS DROPPING IT.** `laying_down` is 1 key and
  0 bones moving, so `resetDuration()` returns 0 and the guard threw it away with
  `CLIP laying_down duration 0` in the chip. That guard is for a NEGATIVE duration -- the
  shared-`times` landmine -- and zero is a different thing entirely: this file already derives
  `aimPose` as a one-key clip at duration .1 for exactly this reason. Negative still reports and
  drops; zero is kept at .1, which it has to be because a clip of duration 0 on repeat divides
  by its own length.
  **AND THE GET-UP IS FIRED ON THE CROSSING, NOT EVERY FRAME PAST IT (`p.gotUp`).** Without the
  edge, `playOnce` rewinds the clip on every frame of the get-up and he never stands -- the same
  shape as the `ONCE` rewind landmine, one level up.
  **THE KNOCK-DOWN HOLDS FULL WEIGHT THROUGH BOTH HALVES**, rather than giving way at
  `landFree` the way an ordinary landing does. That is `landFree`'s own rule pointed the other
  way: it exists so a landing does not cost you a step you were already taking, and a get-up you
  can nudge out of is a get-up nobody ever sees. One `p.land` clock carries the lie AND the
  get-up, which is what keeps `wantSp = 0`, the not-cancellable test and the chip line unchanged.
  **AND `rest` IS `1 - everything already claimed`, NOT `1 - the landing`.** There are two
  one-shot layers now, and two at full weight sum to 2 -- the gait's budget goes negative, which
  over-applies rather than bleeding the bind pose in, but it is the same class of fault. The
  loop closes it in general and a stagger is skipped outright while a landing is live, because
  that overlap is real and the landing should win.
  **m87 SHIPPED BOTH FLIPS OUTSIDE `ONCE`, WHICH IS A BUG FIXED HERE.** They were played through
  `playOnce` and would have LOOPED; `p.flip` clearing on its own clock hid most of it. Every new
  one-shot is in that set now -- the flips, the duck, the two openers and the three reaction
  poses -- and `laying_down` is the whole of what `clampWhenFinished` is for.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE, AND IS EACH ITS OWN BUILD:** the WALL COVER system and the LEDGE system.
  Both need something this game has never had -- a test for "is there a wall/lip near me, and
  which way does it face" -- which is Shredworld's `ledgeGrab`/`HANG` and its solid-box grid, and
  neither the detection nor the state machine is a rider on an animation change. The clips are
  all in the file and measured: `ledge_hang_idle` (2.33 s, 8 bones, a real subtle dangle),
  `ledge_hang_hop_left/right`, `ledge_hang_to_get_up_over_ledge` and `ledge_hang_to_jump_away`,
  all five with hips XZ 0.000 -- **in place, mantle included**, so the code drives the arc and
  the hop distance exactly as it should.

- **THE SECOND JUMP IS A FLIP, AND THE RIGHT PAD HELD AT REST IS A CHARGED BACKFLIP (m87, `AIR`,
  `flipGo`, `backGo`, `flipMarks`, `poseAt`).** *"We're gonna have a double jump. Second jump is a
  flip, a front flip. Also, if you're on the ground and you press and hold the right stick, he
  ducks and it charges a backflip, and then when you release he backflips and it's high."*
  **THE ONLY FREE GESTURE LEFT ON THAT PAD IS A HOLD AT REST, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE ASKED
  FOR.** Up is the trigger, the wind-up and the square-up (`padUp`); down is the guard; sideways
  is the camera; a tap is the jump and a flick is a strike. What nothing has ever read is a thumb
  that goes down, stays near the middle and stays there -- and `MOVE.tapT`/`tapR` already draw
  that line, because they are precisely what makes something NOT a tap. No mode, nothing to be in
  without knowing it.
  **AND A CAMERA DRAG CANNOT BECOME A BACKFLIP, BY CONSTRUCTION.** `out.far` is a HIGH-WATER MARK
  for the whole touch, so one sweep anywhere in the hold kills the charge for the rest of it and
  it can never come back -- the same property that makes this safe to share a pad with the look.
  It is also what makes the trigger, the wind-up and the guard need **no coordination at all**:
  every one of them arms past `fireAt`/`blockAt`, which is far past `tapR`.
  **`.42` WAS A LITERAL IN `bindStick` AND IS `MOVE.tapR` NOW.** Two copies of the tap radius is
  two things to drift, and this build needed the same number to decide what a drag is.
  **THE DUCK IS ONE KEY LIFTED OUT OF THE BACKFLIP'S OWN WIND-UP.** `Backflip` is a STANDING
  backflip: measured off the Hips height it drops from 38.4 to 28.3 over its first third of a
  second, then pushes to a peak at +0.500 and absorbs into a landing at +1.125. That opening dip
  IS the duck, so the charge pose is that frame held -- **in register**, so the release continues
  from the very frame the hold was sitting on and there is no seam to blend over. `aimPose`'s
  trick at a measured time rather than at frame zero, which is why `poseAt` samples through the
  track's OWN interpolant: a component-wise lerp between two quaternion keys is not a rotation.
  **THE THREE LANDMARKS ARE MEASURED, NEVER TYPED (`flipMarks`).** The hips carry the body's
  height off the ground, so a standing flip reads as a dip, a peak and a second dip -- the crouch
  it winds up through, the apex, and the landing absorb. Taking them off the curve means the
  wind-up is FOUND rather than trimmed by hand, and a re-export at any length lands right:
      front_flip   dur 0.833s   crouch 0.000   apex +0.292   air 0.667s
      Backflip     dur 2.167s   crouch 0.333   apex +0.500   air 1.125s
  **AND THE CROUCH NEEDS NO THRESHOLD**, which is the part that makes one function serve both: it
  is the argmin of the hips inside the opening `AIR.scan`, and on a clip with no wind-up that
  argmin is the first key. `front_flip` rises from its very first frame and comes out `from` 0.
  **THE APEX IS THE NUMBER CHOSEN AND `vy` IS DERIVED FROM IT** (m21's rule). An ordinary jump is
  2.81 m and 1.06 s, so even a bare release clears it:
      charge 0.00   apex 3.40 m   vy 11.66   airtime 1.17s
      charge 0.50   apex 5.10 m   vy 14.28   airtime 1.43s
      charge 1.00   apex 6.80 m   vy 16.49   airtime 1.65s
      the double, tapped at the apex of the first   apex +5.19 m   0.98 to 1.21 s of air left
  **THE SECOND JUMP IS SET, NEVER ADDED.** Added to whatever he had, a double off the top of a
  jump goes into orbit and one off the bottom of a fall does nothing; set, it is the same height
  whenever it is spent, which is what makes it a save you can rely on. And the gate is
  `p.jumps === 1`, so **walking off a box grants nothing** -- the double exists only if he
  actually took the first. `coyote` still covers the first .12 s off a ledge.
  **A BACKFLIP SPENDS THE DOUBLE** (`p.jumps = 2`). A front flip started out of a backflip is two
  rotations fighting over one body, and the backflip is already the higher jump of the two.
  **AND THE FLIP RATE IS FLOORED AT 1, NOT FITTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** Stretching a clip to fill
  the air is the board-trick rule from one repo over and it is wrong here: these two are drawn at
  the speed a flip reads at, so slowing one to fill a long hang is slow motion. It is only ever
  sped UP, when the air is too short to fit it -- and at today's heights both come out at exactly
  **1.00**, so that term is the guard for a re-export or a retune rather than a live scaling. The
  flip then finishes with air to spare and `in_air` takes the rest, which is the landing being
  aimed rather than the rotation still coming round.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS WHICH OF THE THREE IT IS.** `DUCK0.62`, `FLIPback0.42`, `FLIPfwd0.31` --
  "it never ducked", "it ducked and the release did nothing" and "it flipped and the rotation is
  wrong" are three bugs with one picture from a phone.
  **STATED GAPS:** there is **no desktop binding**, because m79 maps the left mouse button to the
  right pad at full deflection UP (`stick.R.far = 1`), so the hold can never be at rest -- the
  same gap the guard has. And **nothing here can see a skin** (the GLB is draco and `DRACOLoader`
  wants a Worker), so whether `Backflip`'s frame 8 reads as a duck, and whether 6.8 m is "high"
  rather than silly, are device questions. `mel.AIR` is live.

- **A SMALL BODY LANDS LIGHTER, AND THERE WERE TWO MEASURES OF "SMALL" (m84, `STEP.sizeG`,
  `voxWeight`).** *"I think we need to turn down the footsteps for Clancy cause he's like
  small."*
  **IT IS NOT A CLANCY NUMBER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.** m66 gave every NPC the same `npcG`
  .52 -- one gain for a knee-height sidekick and a 1.85 m orc -- so the honest fix is the one
  the voice already had a day earlier: read the body's own size and let every kind be its own
  weight with nothing typed. `sizeG` 1.1 on the height ratio:
      Clancy h .62 -> x0.319     skater 1.68 -> x0.956     warrior 1.85 -> x1.063
      his walk lands at g 0.033 against an adult's 0.104 -- **32% of an adult footfall**
  **AND THE ADULTS MOVE BY AT MOST 4%**, which is what says this is a size rule rather than a
  Clancy patch. `sizeG` 0 is flat, which is m83 exactly.
  **THE RATE GOES UP WITH IT, ON THE TERM THAT ALREADY MEANT WEIGHT.** `STEP.r0`/`r1` are
  "heavier is lower" across his speed range, so a small body is the same idea on the same term
  rather than a new one -- the metal clangs' rule, for the third time this week. A fifth higher
  and a third as loud is the difference between "quieter" and "smaller".
  **AND BOTH ARGUMENTS DEFAULT TO 1**, so the PLAYER's own `footSnd` call is byte-for-byte what
  it was: this is about the bodies, and he is not one of them.
  **BUT THE REAL FINDING IS THAT I HAD JUST BUILT A SECOND MEASURE OF SIZE.** m83 fitted
  `voxSize` to the collider RADIUS; the footsteps needed the same question answered, and **a
  game with two answers to "how big is this body" has two answers to everything downstream** --
  which is the `KIT.on`-with-three-owners bug wearing a different hat, caught one build after
  creating it rather than four builds later. It is `K.h` for both now, and height is the better
  of the two on its own merits:
      it is the number he SETS per character (*"he should be small"* is `h: .62`)
      it spans **3x** across the roster where the radii span 1.6
      and a radius is collider tuning that only CORRELATES with size
          on RADIUS   Clancy 1.21   skater 1.03   officer 0.97   warrior 0.93
          on HEIGHT   Clancy 1.21   skater 1.01   officer 1.00   warrior 0.99
  **`CVOX.k` IS SOLVED SO CLANCY LANDS EXACTLY WHERE m83 PUT HIM** (1.2081 -> 1.2077), so
  swapping the measure moves the voice by nothing and the feet are the only new thing -- **each
  toggle has to move one variable or neither can be judged**, and only Clancy has a `chirp` so
  no other body's voice exists to change. What it also does is collapse the adults onto 1.0,
  which is the honest answer: they ARE all the same size, and the old spread was reading a
  collider number as a body.
  **`voxWeight` READS `STEP` FROM 78 LINES BELOW IT**, at CALL time, from `bodyFeet` -- not a
  TDZ, and there is a comment saying so, because this file has been bitten eight times by the
  real thing and the shape is worth not mistaking.

- **CLANCY HAS A VOICE, AND THE MECHANISM WAS WORTH MORE THAN THE FILES (m82/m83, `CVOX`,
  `bodyVox`).** *"I think we could steal some of the creature noises from Plutopia for Clancy's
  little noises."* Then: *"No, they're definitely used. Are you sure you're grabbing the right
  ones?"*
  **HE WAS RIGHT AND I HAD GREPPED FOR THE WRONG WORD.** I searched Plutopia for `'creature'`,
  found only the filenames, and shipped m82 saying the bank was unused over there. **The key is
  `beast`**, and `snd.beast` is a whole system: a `beastTick` that picks a near animal every 3.4
  to 8.5 s, six MOODS, a per-creature gap, and a pitch derived from the animal's size. Grepping
  for the value when the thing you want is keyed by a name is how you conclude a live system is
  dead -- **search for the KEY, not for the payload.**
  **AND THE SEVEN FILES ARE UNLABELLED ON PURPOSE, WHICH IS THE ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION.**
  Plutopia's own note: *"Naming one of them 'angry' would spend it on one feeling; kept as one
  voice they are the ISLAND'S voice, and which feeling it is comes out of pitch and weight
  instead."* So there is no calm subset to grab and no angry one -- **all seven are every mood**,
  which means the files were right and it was the MECHANISM that was missing.
  **THE MOOD TABLE IS PLUTOPIA'S, UNCHANGED**, `[rate, gain]`: alarm goes up and gets shorter,
  anger goes down and gets louder, contentment sits low and quiet, a hurt one is a bark at the
  top of its range. One pool doing six jobs, which is the metal clangs' rule (three car tiers by
  PITCH, not three recordings) stated from the other side -- and it is strictly better than the
  single `r` range m82 shipped, because that conflated "which feeling" with "not the same twice".
  The jitter is its own term now.
  **BUT THE SIZE CURVE IS THE ONE THING THAT DOES NOT PORT, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT.**
  Over there it is `pow(1.05 / clamp(rad, .5, 2.6), .45)` -- half an octave across a 5.2x range
  of creature. **Every body in THIS game has a radius between .28 and .46**, so that clamp puts
  all of them on its FLOOR and returns the identical pitch for a knee-high sidekick and a 1.85 m
  orc. Nothing would have thrown; it would just have sounded wrong. Same curve, refitted --
  `ref` .40 over a 1.9x range with `k` .53 solved so that range still spans half an octave
  (`1.92^k = 1.41`):
      Clancy r .28 -> x1.208   skater .38 -> x1.028   hobo .40 -> x1.000   warrior .46 -> x0.929
      span across the roster 1.30x, and the clamp keeps headroom either side
      Clancy's own moods:  calm 1.09   fond 1.14   angry 0.99   alarm 1.50   hurt 1.62
  **A ported number is only as good as the shape of the world it was tuned in**, which is now the
  fourth time across these repos after the see-through hole's radius, the jetpack's palette and
  the aim assist's cone.
  **IT IS READ OFF `K.r`, THE COLLIDER RADIUS THAT ALREADY EXISTS**, so a body added tomorrow is
  pitched for its own size with nothing typed -- and `voxSize` is called from the HIT path too,
  or one body would be two different creatures depending on what happened to him.
  **`BODYSND.grunt` STAYS ON THE HIT PATH RATHER THAN BECOMING A MOOD**, because it maps POWER to
  gain and rate and the mood table cannot: a jab and a full charge are not the same noise. What
  it was missing was only the size term.
  **THE MOODS ARE WIRED TO STATES THAT ALREADY EXISTED, one line each:**
      calm / fond   the ambient tick, and WHICH one is how near you he is. Plutopia picks this
                    off the animal's `trust`; a sidekick has none to grow because he is already
                    yours, so the honest equivalent is that he is happier stood next to you
      alarm         the m81 dive -- the one moment a sidekick's voice has something to be about
      angry         his own swing (`foeSwing`), which is m75's punch
      daze          the get-up, the one beat of a knock-down with no noise on it
      hurt          `dummyBlow`, through `K.voice` -- m62's hook, and it needed no code at all
  **AN EVENT RE-ARMS THE AMBIENT CLOCK**, so a mood and a chirp can never stack and m81's
  two-dive scramble is one yelp rather than two.
  **AND HE ONLY CHIRPS WHEN NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO HIM** -- `hit`, `down` and `up` already have
  a noise, and a chirp on top of a grunt is two voices describing one event, m27's duplicate. The
  clock still runs through them, so he does not go quiet for a minute after a fight.
  **THE INTERVAL IS RE-ROLLED EVERY TIME AND SEEDED AT SPAWN.** A fixed one is a metronome, which
  is what a creature is not (`SMOKE`'s rule, m41); and seeded rather than started at zero, or
  every body chirps on frame one and then on the same frame for ever -- m50's staggered get-ups,
  on the audio side. It is a NUMBER rather than `undefined`, because `undefined -= dt` is NaN and
  a NaN clock is a body that never speaks again (m63).
  **A KIND WITH NO `chirp` NEVER REACHES ANY OF IT** -- no ambient tick, no moods, and `voxSize`
  returns 1 on the hit path -- so the two drunks, the skater, the officer and the orcs are
  byte-for-byte what they were. m38's empty-field pattern, which is why none of this needed a
  gate naming anybody. Giving the skater a voice is two words.
  **NOTHING HERE PASSES `cut` OR `dec`**, which is correct: those are for an IMPACT, a transient
  that has to start at its own peak (m59). A vocalisation plays whole, through `SFX.edge`'s
  ordinary onset trim, which since m59 is relative to the file's own peak and handles a natural
  attack for free.
  **AND `audio/creature_noises` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- `readdirSync` is not
  recursive, so a new asset folder is a new entry there or every file in it goes stale silently.
  **Sixth time**, after `models/buildings` (m25), `audio/plasma_sounds` (m58), `models/towers`
  (m60), `audio/alien_orc_grunt_sounds` (m62) and Shredworld's own.
  **WHAT IS NOT PORTED, AND IS STATED:** Plutopia's `beastTick` picks ONE near animal out of all
  of them so the island speaks with one voice at a time; here every body with a `chirp` runs its
  own clock, which is right for one sidekick and would want that picker the day a second kind
  gets a voice. `mel.CVOX` is live and `mel.snd('creature')` plays one from the console.

- **THE DIVE COULD NOT LEAVE THE WEDGE, AND PAST 7 m THAT WAS ARITHMETIC (m81, `K.dive.clear`).**
  *"The little Clancy sidekick still just constantly walks in front of my shot. His reflexes or
  anticipation are terrible. I feel like the instant I shoot or charge he should jump out of the
  pizza slice of direction of my aim. I should be able to shoot him but it should actually be a
  struggle, not an accidental regular occurrence."*
  **HIS WORD "PIZZA SLICE" IS THE DIAGNOSIS.** m74 built the dive as a FIXED 3.1 m sideways and
  m76 sized that against the BLAST (1.35 m on a pal) and called it done -- but the thing he is
  actually asking to leave is a WEDGE, and a wedge is a different width at every range while
  `v * dur` is the same 3.12 m at all of them:
      needs dd x tan(cone) to reach the edge, from dead on the line
       3 m -> 1.34   5 m -> 2.23   7 m -> 3.13   9 m -> 4.02   11 m -> 4.91
      dive covers 3.12   ->   **break-even 6.99 m, against a `range` of 11**
  So over a third of the range this was defined over was range where the dive fired, played its
  clip, cost its cooldown and **left him in the cone** -- at 11 m it ended 0.28 rad in against a
  0.42 cone. Every previous pass tuned the trigger (m76 moved it off the latch onto `p.armT`,
  which was real) and none of them touched the one number that could not work.
  **SO THE DISTANCE IS SOLVED, NOT TYPED.** `off` is how far off the firing line he is as seen
  from the PLAYER, so his perpendicular from the line is `dd*sin|off|`, the wedge edge at his own
  along-distance is `dd*cos(off)*tan(cone*clear)`, and what is left is what he has to cover. The
  speed falls out of it over `dur` -- m21's rule (the number is the thing you chose, the velocity
  is derived) one move over, and this is the second time in this file a typed distance has been
  the whole bug after the trigger was fixed twice.
  **AND THE CAP IS HONEST RATHER THAN HIDDEN.** Clearing an 11 m wedge in one move is 11.6 m/s,
  which is a teleport, so `vMax` 7.5 bites -- and `cool` 1.0 -> **.25** is what makes that fine:
  the next dive re-solves from wherever he got to and finishes the job. **Two hops of a scramble
  reads better than one impossible leap**, and it stops by itself, because a dive from outside
  the cone never fires. Simulated over the shipped formula:
      at  3 / 5 / 7 m      ONE dive, out at .53 to .68 rad
      at  9 / 11 / 13 m    TWO, 1.6 s, out at .57 to .68
      9 m already .35 off  ONE, and a shorter one -- the solve reads what he has already got
  `cone` .42 -> .52 so he answers a shot loosely lined up rather than one already on him, and
  `range` 11 -> 13.
- **AND THE REFLEX WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH, BECAUSE THE HABIT WAS SWITCHED OFF (m81).**
  m76 wrote this gap down and left it: *"nothing stops him being in the lane while POUNCING --
  joining the fight outranks it, which is right, but it means the one time he is deliberately
  near an enemy you are shooting is the one time the clear is switched off."* **That is not a
  corner case, it is THE case.** `palFoe` returns a MARKED body, a mark is a body you just hit,
  so the pounce is live precisely while the trigger is -- and the pounce `return`s above the lane
  clear. The loop he is describing is exactly that: dive, cooldown, pounce, walk back into the
  line, dive again.
  **`aimLive && clear` STANDS THE POUNCE DOWN**, and that is the whole change -- one clause, with
  `palPost` hoisted above it so there is one call and one answer rather than two. The dive is the
  REFLEX and the clear is the HABIT, and a build that only ever fixed the reflex could not have
  worked however well the reflex was tuned.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE:** the hammer's wind-up does not make him dive. It sets `p.chargeT` rather
  than `p.armT`, and it is a melee -- diving from it would be a sidekick flinching at something
  that cannot reach him. His *"shoot or charge"* is the blaster's charge, which `p.armT` covers.
  And the lane clear is still horizontal and knows nothing about the boxes (m76's other gap).
- **A MELEE TURNS THE LENS (m81, `CAM.melEase`, `p.camWant`).** *"I want to try making it so that
  the camera centers based on my melees -- so if I melee toward the camera, the camera will ease
  to my new forward, and for every direction."*
  **IT IS A WANT, NOT A WRITE, AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY IT COULD BE BUILT HERE.** `cam.az` has
  **exactly one writer** -- this file's oldest standing invariant, and the one that shows up every
  single time it is broken -- so `meleeGo` states a bearing and `stepCam` is the one place that
  spends it, sitting beside the lock's own come-round for the identical reason.
  **AND `h` IS THE DIRECTION HE ACTUALLY STRIKES, taken AFTER `meleeLock` has had its say** -- so
  a locked swing turns the camera onto the MAN rather than onto the thumb, which is m20's "one
  answer" rule arriving on the camera side.
  **THE THUMB OUTRANKS IT**, which is why both drag writers clear it outright rather than being
  averaged with it: an auto-follow fighting a deliberate drag is the loop that never settles.
  **AND IT COSTS NOTHING TO HIS FACING**, because `faceTgt` reads `cam.az` while aiming -- the
  lens and his forward are the same bearing here, which is what makes this a CENTRING rather than
  a second thing to keep in step. The charged dash sets it too; a dash is a melee.
- **A FLICK DOWN IN THE AIR IS A SLAM (m81, `SLAM`, `slamGo`, `slamLand`).** *"If I jump and swipe
  down on right stick he does a slam down to earth, which we can use the same melee as the charge
  attack (minus the charge) because that is actually where that animation fits."*
  **THE GESTURE WAS FREE AND THAT IS WHY IT FITS.** `meleeGo` returns on `!p.grounded`, so a flick
  in the air did nothing at all -- the one unspent thing on a pad whose tap is the jump, whose
  hold is the trigger and whose ground flick is the strike. And DOWN is free specifically: down
  HELD is the guard (m37), and a flick is a fast move and a release, which `padUp`'s own
  hysteresis argument already separates from a hold.
  **THE DIRECTION TEST IS THE PAD'S RAW TRAVEL, NOT `flickH`.** That function maps a flick into
  WORLD space through `cam.az`, which is exactly right for a strike thrown somewhere and
  meaningless for one thrown at the floor: down-the-screen is down-the-screen whatever the camera
  is doing. The pad's +Y is DOWN (`flickH(0, -1)` is the desktop punch and that is straight up).
  **IT ENDS WHEN HE MEETS THE GROUND, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE TEST FROM EVERY OTHER STRIKE** -- they
  all end when he LEAVES it. So it is its own branch rather than a clause on that one: sharing
  that condition would have it cancel itself on the frame it began.
  **AND THE HANG IS WHAT MAKES IT READ.** Dropped straight from the flick it is over in a tenth of
  a second and looks like a fall; stopped dead for `hang` .16 first, it is a wind-up and then a
  drive. **`down` 12 is a DRIVE and not a drop**, which is the difference between slamming and
  falling.
  **THE CLIP IS COMPRESSED TO THE PREDICTED ARRIVAL, WHICH IS KNOWABLE.** The fall height is
  `groundAt` under him, so `t` solves out of `h = down*t + g*t^2/2` -- m8's landmine, and this is
  a state whose length genuinely is not a constant. **And the rate ceiling is not a taste number**:
  the charged dash already plays this same clip over `dashDur + finishTail` = .52 s, so 3.5 is the
  rate he is looking at on it today.
  **A SLAM GOES IN EVERY DIRECTION, SO IT IS A RADIUS AND NOT A CONE.** Every other blow here is a
  cone because it is thrown somewhere; this one throws each man OUTWARD from where it landed,
  which is one bearing per body and not one for the lot -- so it is a loop over `dummyBlow` rather
  than a `dummyHit` call. **A friend is harder to catch through `WEAP.palBlast`**, m76's own
  number, so "how much a friend is spared" stays one dial.
  **AND IT HANDS TO THE HARD LANDING**, because `rateMax` means a low slam plays only part of the
  swing and ending there would snap him from mid-arc into the idle -- a jump cut, which nothing in
  this file is allowed to be. `landing_hard` is a man hitting the ground and pushing back up off
  it, which IS the follow-through, so this took the state that already exists.
  **ONE PER AIRTIME (`p.slamUsed`, cleared where `p.jumps` is)**, or a thumb flicking repeatedly is
  a man hammering the floor all the way down. And **the failsafe may not end it in mid-air**:
  `SLAM.max` can run out before the ground arrives over a drop, and a landing state entered
  airborne is a man lying on nothing -- the ordinary fall takes him from there, which needed no
  case of its own.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `SLAM<dur>` and gains `!` when it connects**, the swing's own idiom: "it never
  fired", "it fired and reached nobody" and "it landed" are three bugs with one picture on a phone.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin, so whether
  `weapon_melee_finish` reads as a slam at 3.5x, whether `hang` .16 is enough of a beat, and
  whether the camera's half-second sweep is decisive or lurching are all device questions.
  `mel.SLAM` and `mel.CAM.melEase` are live, and `melEase = 0` is the one word back to m80.

- **A NEW NPC COST A TABLE AND A LOAD LINE, FOR THE FIFTH TIME (m80, `SKATER`, `buildSkaters`).**
  *"Hey I just added a alien roller skate blue model, can you add her to the game as an NPC?"*
  **THE FILE HAD ARRIVED AND WAS NOT WHERE THE OTHERS ARE.** `models/alien_rollerskate_blue.glb`,
  in `models/` rather than `models/characters/` -- so a listing of the characters folder came back
  with the seven that were already there and said nothing. **`git log --stat -1` is the command**,
  and it is worth reaching for first every time: this repo's other failure mode is an EMPTY commit
  (m58: four of his five "fixed colin" pushes never left his machine), and "the file is somewhere
  else" and "the file never came" are one picture from a directory listing.
  **(SUPERSEDED AT m141: he moved her into `models/characters/` himself in `29944ba`, so
  `SKATER.file` followed. The reasoning below is why it was NOT moved unilaterally.)**
  **IT IS LEFT WHERE HE PUT IT.** `models` is already in `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`, so `A()` hashes her
  contents and a re-export under the same name actually reaches his phone -- and moving it would
  be a 404 the next time he drops the same file in the same place, which is the audio filenames'
  own rule (`gound_01`, `.mp4` in the middle of a skateboard name) one asset type over.
  **AND SHE NEEDED NO BUILDER, NO BRAIN AND NO SECOND PATH.** The bolt, the swept limb, `bodyFly`,
  `bodySep`, `dummyBlow`, the player's own resolver and `foeWander` all reach anything in
  `DUMMIES`, so `buildSkaters` is `buildHobos` with a different table in it. That is `d.K`'s
  dividend for the fifth time and it is why this build is a table and a `side(...)` line.
  **MEASURED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN, which is what those two tools are for** -- and they are
  not a verification pass: `walkRef` and `runRef` are numbers the table CANNOT be written without,
  and eyeballing them is what put the city's rifle run 36% too fast and its walk 37% too slow in
  one build, in opposite directions.
      1 mesh / 1 material / 1 texture, 67 nodes, draco + EXT_texture_webp + specular
      authored height 0.9995 m, soles at EXACTLY 0        -> x1.681 to stand 1.68 m
      toes (0.0000, 1.0000), shoulders cross-check 1.0000 -> +Z, like everyone else here
      NO weapon mounts, which is right -- an NPC, not a wearer
      13 clips; `CINEMA_4D_Main` is the usual one-frame residue
      idle     0.002 m/s   <- THE CONTROL, and the reason the other two can be believed
      walking  0.807 authored, feet AGREE            -> walkRef .81
      running  2.005, **feet disagree 25%** (L 2.26, R 1.75) -> runRef 2.00
  **THAT 25% IS REAL AND IS IN THE CLIP**, reported rather than quietly averaged away -- the
  warrior's own m35 shape. If her run ever reads limpy, that is why.
  **HER TURN CLIPS ARE HER HIT REACTIONS, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT SAID OUT LOUD.** This export is
  locomotion and nothing else: no `hit_*`, no fall, no get-up. On the hick a turn plays as a
  stumble because he is drunk; on a body ON WHEELS a blow that spins her round is what actually
  happens, and m78's `FLAIL.spin` already tumbles her in the air on top of it. The alternative was
  nothing at all, and **a blow that produces the idle is a blow nobody can see landing.** The
  honest fix is drawn poses, and `big` takes the two 90-degree turns so a heavy blow reads wider.
  **THE FALL AND THE GET-UP ARE NAMED AND EMPTY**, m38's pattern: the STATES run either way -- she
  flies, lands, lies there, gets up and runs off -- and naming a clip later is one string with no
  branch to add. m41 is the build that collected on exactly that, one character over.
  **AND SHE IS GIVEN NO `flee` CLIP, WHICH IS ONE FEWER THING TO KEEP IN STEP.** `foeWander` reads
  `K.clips.flee || K.clips.run` and picks `fleeRef` or `runRef` to MATCH, so naming `running`
  twice would be two fields describing one clip and two places for them to drift apart. The
  fleeing read comes from `flee` being the fastest speed on the table.
  **SHE ROLLS, so both her speeds sit just OVER their own references** (x1.11 walking and x1.20
  running, well inside `tsHi` 1.5) -- which makes her the quickest ambler on the street and is as
  far as a walk cycle can be pushed before the feet scramble. **A skating clip is the honest way
  to go faster**, and `walk`/`run` are the two dials until there is one. Her `gait` stops less and
  surges less than a drunk's and her roam ring is 14 m against their 9, because wheels cover
  ground.
  **THE SPAWNS ARE CHECKED AS RECTANGLES, NEVER PLACED BY EYE** -- m60's rule, and it caught two
  things. Each of `[9, 1]`, `[-26, 0]` and `[-7, -25]` clears all ten boxes, the building's plan
  and the tower's by at least 2.1 m, and the nearest of the fourteen other bodies by 7.2 m.
  **And farthest-point sampling had to be CONSTRAINED to the band the street occupies**: run over
  the whole search square it went straight to the corners and put her at 42 m, which is the void
  rather than the test site. 9 to 26 m is where every other body already is.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin (her GLB is draco and
  `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker), so **whether a walk cycle on a body wearing roller skates reads
  as skating at all** is a device question, and so are her height and whether the turn-as-hit
  lands. The arithmetic that CAN be checked -- the scale, the references, the time scales and the
  clearances -- is above and was. `mel.SKATER` is live except `h`, which wants a reload.

- **THE MOUSE BECOMES THE RIGHT PAD, IT DOES NOT BYPASS IT (m79, `DESK`).** *"I need to make
  this game work better on desktop web view. Right now you can move with WASD, which is good, but
  if it detects a mouse have it so the aiming works with the mouse -- left click will be shoot and
  melee, the keys can be locomotion, the camera is look around with the mouse. Space bar will be
  jump, right click for now will be rotate through your weapons from unarmed to blaster to melee.
  Switching the blaster between automatic and charge will maybe be alt."*
  **EVERY VERB IN THIS GAME READS THE RIGHT PAD'S GEOMETRY**, which is why this is fifteen lines
  of input and not a second control layer: `padUp`'s four gates, the guard's mirrored four, the
  flick and the tap all ask where a thumb is. **A second path would be a second answer to "is the
  thumb pushed up"** -- the exact thing m46 spent a build collapsing into one. So holding the left
  button writes `stick.R` to straight-up-at-full-deflection and lets go on release, and the
  trigger, the wind-up, the square-up, the release edge and `chargeRelease` all work with **not
  one line changed**.
  **AND IT WRITES x = 0, WHICH IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY.** `stepCam` turns the camera off
  `stick.R.x`, so a synthetic stick with any lean in it would fight the mouse for `cam.az` --
  **two writers on a camera bearing**, this file's oldest standing invariant and the one that
  shows up every single time. At zero the stick contributes nothing and the mouse is the only
  writer, which is the identical arrangement the phone has.
  **THE YAW IS SPENT IN `stepCam`, NOT IN THE LISTENER**, for that same reason -- and it is a
  DISPLACEMENT rather than a rate, so it is not multiplied by `dt`: the pixels already happened.
  **AIMING AND LOOKING ARE THE SAME THING HERE, WHICH IS WHY ONE DEVICE DOES BOTH.** While aiming
  he faces wherever the lens points, so there is no separate aim axis to bind -- **mouse-look IS
  the aim**, and that falls out of the one-writer rule rather than being arranged. **And there is
  no pitch**: `cam.el` is a constant, so `movementY` has nothing to drive and is ignored rather
  than wired to something invented for it.
  **A TAP IS THE MELEE AND A HOLD IS THE WEAPON'S OWN HOLD**, which is *"shoot and melee"* read
  literally -- and it needed no mode, because `armT` .09 against `tapT` .30 already separates
  them: a click too short to arm the trigger is a punch and anything longer is the charge.
  **Not in rapid fire**, where a tap already spends the hold as a ROUND and punching as well would
  be one click doing two things. The direction is `flickH(0, -1)` -- straight up on the pad, which
  is forward relative to the camera -- so **a desktop strike and a phone strike read the same
  mapping** and cannot disagree about which way forward is.
  **LAST INPUT WINS, RATHER THAN A SNIFF.** `matchMedia('(pointer: fine)')` seeds it so a desktop
  starts right, and a real mouse move or a real touch flips it either way -- so a laptop with a
  touchscreen is never in the wrong mode for more than one gesture, and there is no user-agent
  string to be wrong about. Flipping to desktop releases both pads, which is the m138 stuck-stick
  rule: a mode change with a thumb down is an up nobody will ever hear.
  **THE FIRST CLICK TAKES THE MOUSE AND DOES NOTHING ELSE**, which is the standard bargain and is
  also the only one available -- `requestPointerLock` needs a gesture. Esc gives it back and the
  next click takes it again, and **losing the lock releases the button**, alongside the same
  blur/pagehide/visibilitychange trio the pads have had since m35: all three are ways an up goes
  missing, one input device over.
  **AND THE ROLL GOT A KEY RATHER THAN A STATED GAP.** It is the one thing that saves you -- its
  i-frames are what `p.roll` was always for -- and on a mouse there is no gesture left for it, so
  SHIFT rolls where you are WALKING and falls back to where he faces. That is the left pad's own
  flick read off the keys instead of off a thumb, and it is a judgement rather than something he
  asked for.
  **THE HINT IS BUILT FROM `DESK.hint` AND ONLY SHOWS WHILE THE MOUSE IS FREE.** One place binds a
  key and the same place names it, because a printed map that disagrees with a binding is worse
  than no map; and once the pointer is locked it is a HUD element in the play area saying
  something you already know, which is the `actB` lesson one game over.
  **WHAT IS NOT BOUND, AND IS STATED:** the GUARD. It is right-pad DOWN on the phone and right
  click is spent on the weapon cycle, so there is no desktop block -- which matters more than it
  sounds now that m67 gave the orcs a knock-down that a guard is what keeps you out of. A key
  (`Q`, or holding RMB against a tap to cycle) is the obvious next thing and it is his call which.
  **AND NOTHING IN THIS CONTAINER HAS A MOUSE**, so the sensitivity (`DESK.sens`, about 2000 px
  for a full turn), whether a tap-punch fires too readily, and whether losing the lock to Esc is a
  nuisance are all device questions. `mel.DESK` is live and `mel.DESK.sens` is the dial.

- **ONE BOLT, ONE BODY -- AND THE CHAIN IS THE BETTER WAY TO PUT A CROWD DOWN (m78,
  `WEAP.blastMax`).** *"I shoot it and it hits all three orc warrior aliens at the same time and
  it's just cheap. Maybe the blast should only be able to hit one thing at a time? I do like the
  idea of guys physically running into each other -- I shoot one, he goes flying, hits another."*
  **m36 ASKED FOR THE OPPOSITE AND HE IS RIGHT TO TAKE IT BACK.** *"If I shoot a ball and it hits
  in the general area of a few of them, that should hit more than one at a time"* is a perfectly
  good idea that turns out to play as three men leaving the ground on one frame for one tap --
  which is the whole of "cheap", and which no amount of varying the FLIGHT can rescue, because
  the thing that reads wrong is the simultaneity and not the animation.
  **AND THE SECOND HALF OF HIS MESSAGE IS THE REPLACEMENT.** `FLYHIT` (m63) already puts a crowd
  down and does it **sequentially by construction**: a flyer bowls over the man he reaches, pays
  `cost`, and carries on -- so the second man leaves a beat after the first and the third a beat
  after him. That is the un-simultaneity being asked for, and it is already built. **The two
  halves of his message solve each other**, which is why this is a cap rather than a new system.
  **THE BUDGET COVERS THE DIRECT HIT TOO**, or a ball landing ON somebody would still splash a
  second man and two would go over together -- which is the complaint at a smaller number. The
  direct victim is already on `K.cool` and skipped either way, so this is purely about the COUNT.
  **AND `dummyHit` TAKES THE NEAREST, NOT THE FIRST.** Unbudgeted it catches everyone in range,
  which is what a melee sweep wants (m36's `hitAll`) and what every other caller has always had.
  With a budget, **the order `DUMMIES` happens to be stored in would otherwise decide who dies** --
  the same class of arbitrariness as a tiebreak that flips, and invisible until three men stand
  in a line.
  **THE REACH CAME DOWN WITH IT, WHICH IS THE JUDGEMENT HALF AND IS SAID AS ONE.** The cap is
  what answers his complaint; 4 m to catch ONE man is still "I did not aim at him and he died":
      full charge   ball .95 + blast 2.60 + warrior .46  =  **4.01 m**  ->  3.01 m
      fumble                .225 + .55 + .46 = 1.24      ->  1.04 m
      the DIRECT hit in flight, 1.41 m at a full charge  ->  **untouched** (m56, m70)
  `mel.WEAP.blastMax = 9` is the one word back to m36 and `mel.WEAP.blast1` is the other dial.
- **AND NO TWO MEN FLY THE SAME WAY (m78, `FLAIL`).** *"Is there any way to make their flail in
  the air unique somehow. I shoot all three, they all go flying at the exact same time and do the
  exact same animation timed exactly the same, so it looks repetitive."* Three separate things
  were shared, and m50 had already fixed the two on the far side of them -- the LIE and the
  GET-UP are rolled per body and have been since *"they all get up at the exact same time"*. The
  FLIGHT never was.
      beat   the fall clip played at `K.downBeat` exactly, so two men hit the same pose on the
             same frame. `d.downB` now, rolled at the knock-down, and **read by the state length
             as well as the clip scale** -- the m8 landmine, which is precisely what a per-body
             beat walks into. `downVary` [.80, 1.25] on `downBeat` 1.5 is 1.20 s to 1.88 s.
      arc    and the launch `k` was a pure function of `power`, so two men blown by one event
             left on IDENTICAL trajectories and landed on the same frame. That is the one that
             matters, because **a clip rate cannot change when he arrives**: `flyVary`
             [.86, 1.16] on the warrior's `flyUp` 8.5 gives 7.31 to 9.86 m/s up, an apex of 1.34
             to 2.43 m and a hang time of 0.73 to 0.99 s -- so two men launched on the same frame
             land as much as **a quarter of a second apart**, which is fifteen frames.
      spin   a tumble about his own axis. There is ONE fall clip per direction and no amount of
             rolling numbers makes one clip into two, so what is left is to turn him while he is
             in the air -- which is what "flail" reads as and is the cheapest thing on screen.
             Up to 5 rad/s, about two thirds of a turn over a typical flight.
  **THE BOTTOM OF THE SPIN RANGE IS ZERO ON PURPOSE.** A man who simply goes over backwards is
  one of the ways this should read, and **a street where everybody spins is as uniform as a
  street where nobody does** -- which is the m50 lesson stated forwards.
  **IT IS A PROPERTY OF THE EVENT, NOT OF A KIND**, so `FLAIL` sits beside `FLYHIT` and every
  body gets it, `PALMARK`'s own argument. A kind may still name its own `downVary`/`flyVary`.
  **THE TUMBLE LIVES IN `bodyFly` BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THAT KNOWS HE IS IN THE AIR** --
  `d.stuckT`-in-`foeMove`'s own argument -- and it is an OFFSET on top of `d.h` rather than a
  write to it, so the brain's bearing is untouched and the get-up still faces where `d.back` says.
  **AND IT IS WRAPPED BEFORE IT IS UNWOUND.** A long flight banks several turns and damping THAT
  to zero is a visible spin-up on a man lying still; wrapped to half a turn on landing, what is
  left reads as settling and is gone long before the get-up starts.
  **`bodyFly`'s EARLY RETURN HAD TO LEARN ABOUT IT**, which was a real bug and not a detail: the
  velocity is zeroed the moment he settles, so `if (!vx && !vz && !vy) return` fires on the very
  next frame -- the tumble freezes where it stopped, and he lies on the floor at an angle and
  then STANDS UP at that angle. A state that needs a per-frame step has to keep its stepper alive.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin, so whether a
  tumbling man reads as a flail or as a bug is a device question, and so is whether one body per
  bolt now feels weak. The arithmetic -- the hang times, the apexes, the blast reaches and the
  budget -- is above and was. `mel.FLAIL.spin = [0, 0]` turns the tumble off alone;
  `mel.FLAIL.flyVary = [1, 1]` and `mel.FLAIL.downVary = [1, 1]` are the other two A/Bs.

- **AN ORC SWINGS AT THE LITTLE GUY, AND THE WHOLE BRAIN FOLLOWED ONE PAIR OF NUMBERS (m77,
  `foeTarget`, `K.foePal`, `K.hitPow`, `d.sfoe`).** *"Let's have the warrior orcs also swing at
  the little guy and hit him. Send him in the air."*
  **`foeAI` IS WRITTEN AGAINST `dd` AND `toP` AND NOTHING ELSE**, both derived from `player.pos`
  in its first three lines -- so pointing those two at a BODY is the whole change, and the
  approach, the lane, the circle, the giving ground, `foePlan`'s range test and `foeSwing` all
  come with it. No second brain, no second state, no target field threaded through six branches.
  That is `d.K`'s dividend for the seventh time, and the reason an attack on a new victim cost
  less than the dive did.
  **TWO WAYS HE PICKS ONE, AND THEY NEED DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.** Nearer-than-you is a rule about
  geometry and retaliation is a rule about history, so one is a per-frame test and the other is a
  LATCH -- and the latch is what carries the case the test can never see, because a pal who has
  just punched an orc is usually still the FURTHER of the two.
      foePal.near 1.2   how much nearer than you he has to be to be worth turning onto. Without
                        a margin the orc flips between the two of you every time the gap crosses,
                        which is `LOCK.keep`'s own lesson one system over.
      foePal.hold 2.4   how long the pick survives. The picker REFRESHES it rather than
                        re-deciding, so a retaliation outlives the geometry that contradicts it.
  **A KIND WITH NO `foePal` NEVER FIGHTS A PAL**, so the two drunks and the officer are
  byte-for-byte what they were -- m38's empty-clip-name pattern, one field over.
  **THE 5th ARGUMENT OF `dummyBlow` IS THE ATTACKING BODY NOW, NOT A BOOLEAN.** m75 only needed
  `1` for "this came from a pal"; the moment an orc can be hit BY the pal, the victim has to know
  WHO hit him or there is nothing to turn onto. `if (!pal)` reads identically, so every existing
  call site is untouched -- what is added is that a blow names its author. **And `foeStrike`
  passes `d`**, which is also what keeps the pal from being MARKED: `d.mark` is YOUR interest in a
  body, and an orc hitting the sidekick is not something you did.
  **THE BLOW GOES THROUGH `dummyBlow`, SO THE LAUNCH WAS ALREADY WRITTEN.** The grunt, the shove,
  the reaction pool, the health, the knock-down and the flight are all there, and **a man knocked
  far enough is a flyer in his own right**, so the chain into whoever he lands on falls out of
  `FLYHIT` (m63) rather than being coded. CLANCY's `downF`/`downB` are `falling_to_roll` and his
  get-up is `cover_to_stand`, so he rolls, stands and comes back with no state added anywhere.
  **`hitPow` .92 IS WHERE IN THE LAUNCH RANGE IT LANDS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF HOW FAR HE
  GOES.** CLANCY's `fling` is .45, so anything over it launches; `dummyBlow` then grades `k`
  from `fly0` .55 to 1 across .45..1, **squared**. At .92 that is k .879 on `flyV` 18 and
  `flyUp` 7.5 -- **6.6 m/s up, an apex of 1.09 m at `flyG` 20, 0.66 s of air and about seven
  metres of travel** after `flyDrag` 1.2. That is "in the air" rather than a stagger, and it
  leaves the player's own finisher at 1.0 as the biggest thing in the game.
  **AND `d.hp = K.hp` ON THE KNOCK-DOWN**, which is why two swings do not accumulate into
  anything: he is launched on the first one whatever his health says, and stands up whole.
  **THE TARGET IS LATCHED WHERE THE SWING STARTS (`d.sfoe`), NOT READ AT THE CONTACT FRAME.**
  `foeTarget` runs every frame and the blow lands `swingAt` .42 of the way through a 0.85 s
  swing, so reading it late is a mace thrown at one man landing on another -- **the picture and
  its consequence have to be ONE event**, which is `MELEE.at`'s own rule and the reason the blow
  was moved off the input frame in the first place.
  **A MAN ON THE FLOOR IS FINISHED WITH**, `palFoe`'s rule pointed the other way: a launched pal
  drops out of the picker and clears the latch at once, so the orc turns back to you while Clancy
  rolls, gets up and runs in again. That is what makes it a LOOP rather than an execution, and it
  needed one clause rather than a state.
  **AND THE CHIP SAYS `· vsPAL` / `· PALDOWN`.** "An orc never went for him" and "one did and it
  did nothing" are opposite bugs and one picture from a phone -- and the pal's own state cannot
  answer it, because `PALDOWN` is equally what a stray bolt from you looks like. `vs` reads the
  ORCS (`DUMMIES.some(d => d.foe === pal)`), which is the half only they know.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin (every character GLB
  is draco and `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker), so whether the punt reads as a launch, and whether
  an orc peeling off to chase the sidekick is fun or annoying, are device questions. The
  arithmetic that CAN be checked -- the apex, the hang time, the travel, and that `hitPow` sits
  over CLANCY's `fling` and under the player's finisher -- is above and was. `mel.FOE.foePal =
  null` is the one word back to m76, and `mel.FOE.hitPow` is the dial for how far he goes.
  **AND CLANCY DOES NOT GUARD, DODGE OR RUN FROM A SWING.** His `dive` reads `player.aim` and
  knows nothing about a mace, `vary.guard` is `[0, 0]` and `flee0` is 0 -- so he takes it. That
  is a stated gap rather than a claim; a `foeDive` on an orc winding up is the obvious next thing
  and it is its own build.

- **THE RING HAD A HOLE IN IT AND THE RETURN LEG RAN STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE (m76, `palPost`).**
  *"He constantly walks down the runway, basically down my line of sight -- if I shoot him once
  and he's downfield, then he's just running back to me in front of me and I'm shooting guys."*
  **m74 FIXED THE RING AND LEFT THE ONE PATH THAT IS ALWAYS IN THE LANE.** The catch-up was
  `faceTo(d, toP, dt)` -- **straight at the player** -- which from downfield is the runway by
  definition, so the single moment he was guaranteed to be in the line was the moment he was
  coming back from having been shot. His sentence describes the geometry exactly.
  **AND CLOSING FIRST IS WHAT MAKES IT A RUNWAY, WHICH IS WHY A POST BESIDE YOU IS NOT ENOUGH.**
  A point at your flank is still reached by walking the length of the lane if he starts at the
  far end of it. So inside the lane the target keeps **HIS OWN RANGE** and only moves him
  SIDEWAYS -- he steps off the runway at whatever distance he is at, and only once he is clear
  does the target become a post beside you. One continuous steer, no state, and it falls out of
  the same `off` the ring was already being pushed by.
  **AND STANDING IN THE LANE IS ITS OWN REASON TO MOVE**, not merely a detail of coming back: he
  can wander in, be shoved in, or simply have you turn onto him. The test is WHERE HE IS rather
  than what he was doing, which is why it outranks the ring.
  **`laneArc` .70 IS NARROWER THAN `palArc` 1.05 AND THE GAP IS HYSTERESIS.** The roam point is
  PUSHED to `palArc`, so a clear that triggered at `palArc` would fire on the spot he had just
  been sent to, every frame, for ever. Same shape as `leash`/`leashIn` and as m36's `hold`/`reach`.
  **AND HE RUNS OUT OF IT.** Ambling off the runway is the same complaint as the delayed dive,
  one system over -- and since every path into that branch is either a catch-up or a lane clear,
  both of which are runs, there is no walk case to write. The chip says `· LANE`.
- **THE DIVE FIRED ON THE LATCH AND THE SHOT WAS ALREADY LEAVING (m76).** *"If I'm aiming down
  sight he should basically know to get out of the way, rather than he's kind of delayed."*
  `p.aim` only goes true after `WEAP.armT` of the thumb being up there, and a dive takes `dur`
  .60 s to deliver -- so the earliest he could start was already late. `p.armT > 0` is the moment
  the thumb ARRIVES, which is the earliest thing there is to know, and it is free.
  **THE CONE IS WHAT BUYS THE REST**, .30 -> .42: at .30 he only reacted to a shot already on top
  of him, and at .42 he is reacting to one lined up on him. `range` 9 -> 11 and `cool` 1.6 -> 1.0.
- **AND A DIVE THAT CANNOT OUTRUN THE SPLASH IS NOT A DIVE (m76, `WEAP.palBlast`).** *"Part of it
  is the blast radius of the charge cannon... maybe we could narrow the collider for the charge
  cannon or something."* The arithmetic says he is right and says which half:
      a full charge's blast on a body   size*.5 + blast  =  .95 + 2.60 = 3.55 m, + his r = 3.83
      m74's dive carried him            v 4.0 x dur .60  =  **2.4 m**
  So he could clear the LINE perfectly and still be inside the blast of a shot that landed on
  somebody else -- **the dive could not win against the weapon however well it was timed**, which
  is the "I end up shooting him a bunch" that survived m74.
  **BOTH ENDS MOVED, AND ONLY THE AREA HALF OF THE WEAPON.** `palBlast` .30 is a multiplier on
  the SPLASH reach for a `pal` body only: 1.35 m rather than 3.83. **The DIRECT hit is unscaled
  and unchanged** -- aiming at him still hits him, which is m74's own *"doesn't mean I can't hit
  him"* -- and no enemy's blast moved, so the weapon he tuned is the weapon he still has. And
  `dive.v` 4.0 -> 5.2 carries him **3.1 m**, which is now comfortably outside that 1.35.
  **IT IS ONE OPTIONAL ARGUMENT ON `dummyHit`, PASSED BY THE BLAST CALL AND NOT BY THE FLIGHT
  CALL** -- which is what keeps "a friend is harder to splash" and "a friend is harder to hit"
  from becoming the same number by accident.
- **TIGHTER, AND `hunt` IS DELIBERATELY NOT (m76).** *"I kind of want him on a little tighter of a
  leash. I like that he can go far away, but I want him to try to get back into a more closer
  position."* Two halves of one sentence that pull opposite ways, and they are two different
  numbers: `leash` 4.0 -> 3.2, `leashIn` 1.8 -> 1.1 and `roam` 2.2 -> 1.7 are the coming-back;
  **`pounce.hunt` 9 is the only thing that takes him properly far and it is untouched**, because
  that is the going-away he said he likes.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE:** the lane clear is horizontal and has no idea about the boxes, so he can
  step sideways into one and fall through to m74's stuck-then-hop on the wall. And nothing stops
  him being in the lane while POUNCING -- joining the fight outranks it, which is right, but it
  means the one time he is deliberately near an enemy you are shooting is the one time the clear
  is switched off. `mel.CLANCY.laneArc = 0` turns the whole clear off for an A/B.

- **HE PILES ON TO WHATEVER YOU ARE HITTING, AND THE SWING IS THE WARRIOR'S OWN MACHINERY
  (m75, `PALMARK`, `palFoe`, `K.pounce`).** *"Let's make him attack with the mutant punch."*
  **"ONLY ATTACK IF YOU'RE ATTACKING SOMETHING" IS A MARK ON THE MAN, NOT A MOOD.** m73's standing
  permission had a condition in it, and the condition is a fact about a BODY rather than a state
  in the sidekick: `dummyBlow` is the one function every blow on a body reaches, so it is the one
  place that can stamp *you are fighting this one*, and `palFoe` only ever returns a body still
  carrying that stamp. He therefore never starts a fight, never wanders off after one, and stops
  when you stop -- **no aggro of his own, and nothing to tune about when he decides to engage.**
  **AND HIS OWN PUNCH DOES NOT REFRESH IT** (`pal` 1 on that one call), or he would keep his own
  victim alive as a target for ever and never come back. The mark is YOUR interest.
  **`PALMARK` IS A PROPERTY OF THE EVENT, NOT OF A PAL**, so it is a constant beside `FLYHIT`
  rather than a field on his table -- a second sidekick tomorrow reads the same mark and there is
  nothing to keep in step.
  **THE ATTACK IS A TABLE AND ONE BRANCH.** `swings`, `swingDur`, `swingAt`, `swingGap`, `hitR`
  and `hitArc` are the fields `foeSwing`, `foeAI`'s `swing` branch and `foeStrike` have read since
  m35 -- so naming them on `CLANCY` IS the attack, and the only new code is a branch in
  `foeStrike` that swings at a BODY instead of at the player. The beat, the contact frame, the
  lean through the blow and the cooldown all came with it. **That is `d.K`'s dividend for the
  sixth time**, and it is why an attack cost less than the hop did.
  **`mutant_punch` IS 1.167 s AND PLAYS AT x1.37** -- m37's rule, that a reaction too fast to read
  is the same reaction every time -- and `swingGap` .45 puts a punch every ~1.3 s, which is a
  helper chipping in rather than a second fighter.
  **`power` .34 IS UNDER THE WARRIOR'S `fling` .70 AND HIS `hard` 1.01 BY CONSTRUCTION**, so a
  sidekick's punch staggers and shoves (`knock` 4.2 x .34 = 1.43 m/s, 0.65 m at `shoveDrag` 2.2)
  and can never put a man down. That is right rather than a limitation: **knocking them over is
  yours.** `dmg` 2.0 through the same `max(.35, power)` is 0.70 a punch against 6 hit points, so
  he is worth about a third of a fight.
  **A MAN ON THE FLOOR IS FINISHED WITH.** `palFoe` skips `down` and `up`, which is what makes him
  disengage and come back rather than stand over a downed warrior punting him for ever --
  `dummyBlow`'s punt branch would happily let him.
  **AND JOINING THE FIGHT OUTRANKS THE LEASH, DELIBERATELY.** `hunt` 9 is further than `leash` 4 --
  but the range is measured from YOU rather than from him, so he can never be more than `hunt`
  away however long it runs, and the leash takes him back the moment the marks expire.
  **`foePlan` HAD TO BE GATED ON `pacifist`.** The swing branch ends by planning what to do next,
  and that function picks between a guard, a circle and giving ground -- **a fight against the
  player**, which is the one thing a sidekick's swing must not end in. One clause, and the drunks
  (who have no `swings` and can never reach it) are unaffected either way.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE:** he does not answer a warrior who is attacking YOU but whom you have not
  hit yet -- his own sentence is "if you're attacking something", and `aggro` would be the other
  signal if that is wanted. `mutant_swiping` and `jump_attack` are still unnamed, so there is one
  strike and no chain. And a target behind a box makes him walk into it, build `stuckT` and hop at
  the wall on m74's own timer: self-limiting, visible in the chip, and not pretty.
  **The chip says `· PUNCH`.** `mel.CLANCY.pounce = null` takes the attack away entirely.

- **THE 40 cm CUBE STOPPED BEING WALKABLE WHEN THE PLAYER SHRANK, AND ONLY THE COMMENT STILL
  THOUGHT OTHERWISE (m74).** *"He can't get up on -- there was a really short little cube he just
  got stuck on. He just indefinitely was kind of stuck, didn't know what to do."* Read straight
  out of the world builder, and it is the box nearest the spawn:
      put(6, 0, -3, 3, .40, 3, 0);   // "under MOVE.step, so this one is WALKED onto"
  `MOVE.step` is `.5 * SZ`. At `RIG.height` 1.75 that was **0.50 m** and the claim was true; m52
  took him to 1.45 and m57 to 1.25, and the step came down **to 0.357 m** with him -- so this box
  has been a WALL since m57, to the player as much as to anybody, and the 0.35 platform beside it
  is still walkable by seven millimetres. **A comment describing an intent the code no longer has
  is the tell**, and this file already has that sentence about `blast0`'s own comment at m56.
  **THE BOX IS LEFT ALONE AND THE CLAIM IS CORRECTED.** A low obstacle is a fair thing for a test
  site to have, and changing the world to suit a body is the wrong instinct -- he asked for the
  sidekick to be able to get up on things, not for the things to get shorter.
- **HE TRIES, THEN HE HOPS, THEN HE GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE (m74, `d.stuckT`, `K.hop`, `K.give`).**
  Both halves of that report are ONE detector, and it lives in `foeMove` because **that is the
  one place a body is ever told to travel** -- so it is the one place that knows both what was
  asked and what was delivered, and comparing those two needs nothing from the state machine.
  That makes it equally true of a wall, a kerb, another body and a corner. **A detector every
  caller has to remember is not a detector**, which is this file's own sentence about `roadTag`
  one repo over.
      stuckT > hop.at .55   -> he jumps at the thing
      stuckT > give   1.6   -> that point is unreachable; re-roll it
  **THE ORDER IS WHAT MAKES IT READ AS A CREATURE**: a hop first, and only when that has not
  helped does he give up on the point. And it DECAYS at twice the rate it builds, so a body that
  scrapes past something forgets rather than carrying a grudge into the next corner.
  **THE HOP IS AN ARC SOMEBODY CHOSE, SO THE APEX IS THE NUMBER** -- m21's rule, and `vy` is
  derived from it rather than picked. At `flyG` 20:
      up 4.8   apex **0.576 m**, 0.48 s of air   -- clears the 0.40 box by 18 cm
                                                 -- does NOT clear the 1.15 one, which is right
      fwd 3.0  x 0.48 s = **1.44 m** of travel   -- exact, because `leapDrag` is 0
  **AND 3.0 IS UNDER `FLYHIT.at` 6 BY CONSTRUCTION**, so a hopping sidekick can never bowl a
  warrior over. That needed no case at all -- only a number kept under one that already exists.
  **IT OWNS NOTHING BUT A VELOCITY.** `d.vx/vy/vz` and `bodyFly` -- the integrator the knock-down
  flight has used since m37 -- so the wall bounce, the ground stop and the landing thump come
  with it and there is no second physics path. **What it did need is `K.leapDrag`**: `flyDrag` is
  right for a body that was THROWN and wrong for one that jumped, and a drag on top of a solved
  arc makes the arithmetic above a lie and lands him short of the thing he jumped at.
  **AND THE STATE HAS TO SIT ABOVE `foeWander`**, which ends in `foeMove`, which snaps `P.y` to
  the ground: walking and flying at once is a hop that never leaves the floor.
  **THE MINIMUM (`d.t > .12`) IS WHAT STOPS IT ENDING ON THE FRAME IT BEGAN** -- `bodyFly` runs
  at the TOP of `stepDummies`, so on the launch frame the velocity has not been integrated yet
  and he is still standing on the floor.
  **BOTH ARE GATED ON THE KIND'S OWN FIELDS**, so the drunks are byte-for-byte unchanged. A stuck
  drunk is a real bug too and it is a different build, not a free ride on this one.
- **THE RING HAS A HOLE IN IT WHERE YOU ARE POINTING (m74, `K.palArc`).** *"The leash is too long.
  I do want him to more or less stay near me, checking out what I'm doing, stand off the side of
  me. He goes in front of me a lot and then I just end up shooting him."* Two separate things and
  the second is the one that matters: a uniform ring puts him in front of you a third of the
  time, for ever, whatever its radius.
      leash 7.0 -> 4.0    leashIn 3.2 -> 1.8    roam 4.2 -> 2.2    roamAt .7 -> .5
      palArc 1.05 rad (60 deg either side of your nose) that the roam point may not be in
  **`player.faceH` IS THE FIRING BEARING AND IT ALREADY EXISTS.** While aiming he faces wherever
  the lens looks -- the one-writer-on-`cam.az` invariant -- so the arc to keep clear of needed no
  second number to keep in step with the first.
  **AND THE ANGLE IS PUSHED TO THE NEARER EDGE, NOT RE-ROLLED.** A rejection loop is unbounded;
  a push is one line. It also piles him up along the two EDGES of the arc, which is *"off the
  side of me"* rather than merely "anywhere but in front" -- the better behaviour falls out of
  the cheaper implementation, which is worth noticing rather than arguing about.
- **AND THE DIVE IS THE BACKSTOP, NOT THE FIX (m74, `K.dive`).** *"Maybe he jumps out of the way,
  doesn't mean I can't hit him. I don't think I have a dive animation or a roll animation but if
  we do, you could like dive roll out of the way."*
  **HE HAS ONE AND IT IS ALREADY IN HIS TABLE.** `falling_to_roll`, 1.875 s -- a body going down
  into a roll, which is what a dive IS, and m73 wired it as his knock-down. Second build running
  that the clip he thinks he has not drawn is in the export: **read the file before taking his
  word for what is missing from it.** Compressed to `dur` .60, which is x3.1.
  **NO I-FRAMES, WHICH IS WHAT HE ASKED FOR AND IS ALSO THE SIMPLER THING.** It MOVES him and
  nothing else: 4.0 m/s for .60 s is **2.4 m** out of the line, against a `cone` of .30 rad which
  is 2.7 m of half-width at the 9 m range. So he clears most of the way out of a shot he was
  standing in, and a shot that was going to hit him anyway still does.
  **AND IT IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE LINE, NOT AWAY FROM YOU** -- away from you is down the barrel,
  which is the whole difference between getting clear and running at the muzzle. The side comes
  off the sign of his own offset from the line, so he goes the way he was already leaning.
  **`p.aim` COVERS BOTH TRIGGERS** -- it is true for the charge and for rapid fire -- so one test
  rather than two to keep in step.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE:** `crouched_sneaking_left/right` and `left/right_cover_sneak` are a sidestep
  set that would read better than a roll for a small dodge, and nothing names them. And there is
  no attack: `mutant_punch`, `mutant_swiping` and `jump_attack` are all in the file, *"you're
  welcome to make him attack, I don't really care"* is the standing permission, and it is its own
  build rather than a rider on this one.
- **AND THE CHIP SAYS WHICH OF THE THREE IT IS (m74).** *"He just indefinitely was kind of stuck"*
  is the report, and "he never hopped", "he hopped and it did nothing" and "he is stuck and never
  tried" are three different bugs with one picture from a phone. `· HOP`, `· DIVE`, `· STUCK1.4`
  -- and the STUCK CLOCK is the one that separates them, because it is the thing both the hop and
  the give-up are triggered off. Silent while he is simply pottering about, `rollREC`'s rule.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED AND WHY:** nothing in this container can build a skin (his GLB is draco and
  `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker), so the hop's apex, the dive's read and whether the ring now keeps
  him out of the way are all device questions. The arithmetic that CAN be checked -- the apex, the
  flight time, the travel, and that `fwd` sits under `FLYHIT.at` -- is above and was.

- **A SIDEKICK IS m38'S PACIFIST WITH THE RING MOVED (m73, `CLANCY`, `K.pal`, `K.clips.rest`).**
  *"He's basically like your little sidekick, so he just sort of follows you around... I don't want
  it to be like super super mechanical, I want him to kinda wander a little bit and walk around a
  sort of radius around you. I kinda just want him to be your little dog sidekick that hangs out
  and is fairly autonomous, but stays within a certain radius of you."*
  **EVERY WORD OF THAT EXCEPT ONE IS ALREADY `foeWander`.** m38 built the amble for a drunk: a roam
  ring, a stop timer, a look-about flourish and m50's surge-and-hesitate breathing -- which is
  precisely *"wander a little bit"* and *"not super super mechanical"*, written and shipped three
  builds before anybody asked for a sidekick. **The only thing a follower changes is WHICH POINT
  the ring is round**, so that is the only thing the branch changes: `d.hx/d.hz` become the
  player's position instead of the spawn. Six lines, and the wander, the stops, the idles, the
  clip scaling and the pacifism come with it.
  **AND BEING HITTABLE COST NOTHING AT ALL**, which is `d.K`'s own dividend for the fifth time: the
  bolt, the swept limb, `bodyFly`, `bodySep`, `dummyBlow`, the player's resolver and the fly-into-a-
  body chain all reach anything in `DUMMIES`. *"I wanted to be able to be hit by both you and
  NPCs"* is a table and a load line, and his own roll and landing clips are wired into the states
  m38 and m41 already wrote.
  **THE LEASH IS WHAT KEEPS IT A RADIUS RATHER THAN A DRIFT, AND IT NEEDS TWO NUMBERS.** He stops
  wandering past `leash` 7.0 and comes back at a run, and goes back to ambling at `leashIn` 3.2 --
  **the gap between them is hysteresis**, and one number would flip him between amble and dash on
  the boundary every frame. That is the m36 `hold`/`reach` lesson one body over, and it is also
  why the catch-up state is a LATCH (`d.catch`) rather than a distance test.
  **WHICH IDLE HE HOLDS IS A POOL PICKED FRESH ON EACH STOP.** *"I got some idles titled Clancy
  idle one and Clancy idle two, those are the main ones I want, but I do have like four more idles
  in addition that you can mix in randomly."* Two facts, two fields: `rest` is the pool he SETTLES
  into and `look` is the existing one-shot flourish, which is exactly what four occasional extras
  are. **`K.clips.idle` stays a single string**, because nine other places read it as the
  structural fallback and a pool there would have been nine readers to change for one character.
  **And the pool goes into `bodyLoops`** -- an idle is held, so it loops like the one in `idle`
  does; `look` deliberately does not, because looping a one-shot flourish is a tic.
  **HE DOES NOT RUN AWAY (`flee0: 0`).** m38's pacifist flees when hit, which is what a drunk does
  and is the opposite of a sidekick: the one thing a dog does when you get into a fight is stay.
  The flee branch is untouched and simply never entered, rather than being gated on `pal`.
  **AND HE HAS NO HEALTH BAR**, because `foeBar` is a call `buildClancy` does not make. A gauge
  over the head of the thing on your own side reads as a target.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE AND IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN:** he cannot keep up with a full 7.2 m/s
  sprint -- `running` is walking at 1.44 m/s and `run` 2.6 is already above its own reference, so
  a faster approach than the clip can sell is a scramble and the leash plus the catch-up is the
  honest answer. Nothing calls the mutant attack clips. And **nothing in this container can build
  a skin** (the GLB is draco and `DRACOLoader` wants a Worker), so his scale at `h` .62, his facing
  and whether a knee-high alien reads as a dog are all device questions. `mel.CLANCY` is live
  except `h`, which is measured at load and wants a reload.

- **A LUNGE COULD CARRY HIM SIXTEEN METRES, AND THE MAN DECIDED IT (m72, `MELEE.lungeMax`).**
  *"When I melee he launches forward quite a bit -- sometimes I wanna cap that distance, sometimes
  it's ridiculous. We're starting to develop a bit more of a system, and I don't want him to launch
  so far forward -- unless I make an animation for an actual launch, like a slide tackle or flying
  kick. As is, he can go forward, but it should be more capped."*
  **"SOMETIMES" IS THE WORD THAT NAMES THE CAUSE.** m51's solve is right and stays: the lock
  inverts `v * dur * carryAvg` so the swing lands ON him, which is why a man at arm's length gets
  a punch thrown on the spot. But that means **where the MAN is was the only thing setting the
  distance**, and the ceiling was never chosen -- it fell out of `maxV` 28 times whichever beat
  was playing. Measured, with `arrive` 0.75 m:
      strike  beat   ACQUIRE out to      then TRAVELS      free travel
      jab     .62    12.59 -> 5.35 m     11.84 -> 4.60 m   3.15 -> 3.15 m
      two     .68    13.80 -> 5.35       13.05 -> 4.60     3.20 -> 3.20
      finish  .82    16.65 -> 5.35       15.90 -> 4.60     5.35 -> 4.60
  On a 1.25 m body that is **ten to thirteen of his own heights** for a jab. A launch, and he has
  not drawn one yet -- so it is capped rather than made a feature.
  **IT IS METRES, NOT A LOWER `maxV`, BECAUSE A SPEED CAP IS THREE DIFFERENT DISTANCES HERE.**
  The beats are .62 / .68 / .82, so one velocity ceiling leaves the finisher travelling 32%
  further than a jab however it is tuned. **Distance is what he asked to cap**, and it becomes a
  speed through the same `dur * carryAvg` the solve already inverts.
  **AND IT CAPS BOTH PATHS, SO THEY CANNOT DISAGREE.** An unlocked finisher covered 5.35 m off
  `lunge[2]`, so capping only the SOLVE would leave a swing at NOBODY travelling further than a
  swing at a man -- a lock that makes him move less is worse than no lock. One number governs how
  far a strike carries whether or not it found anybody; strikes 1 and 2 free are already under it
  and are byte-for-byte unchanged.
  **AND THE ACQUIRE RADIUS HAD TO COME DOWN WITH IT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS.** A
  man further off than the lunge can deliver has to be REFUSED, or he is aimed at somebody he then
  falls short of and swings at the air -- m20's rule (an assist's range is sized for what it
  DELIVERS, not for what it draws) and `chargeAim`'s `acq` one move over. `lungeMax + arrive` is
  that radius by construction.
  **AND THAT FIXES m40's OWN COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS STILL HALF TRUE.** That note says *"`maxV` is
  also an acquire radius -- a number meant for one thing must not be shared with another"* and
  then left it shared: `reachMax` read it for the radius while the clamp read it for the speed.
  It is a speed ceiling only now, and the distance cap is what decides the reach.
  **THE CHARGED DASH IS NOT THIS AND KEEPS ITS OWN `flatFar` 11.** It is the move that is
  SUPPOSED to cross ground, it has its own clip, its own `dashV` and its own `acq`, and m43/m45
  were three builds of getting its distance to mean anything. Capping both through one number
  would undo that.
  **`mel.MELEE.lungeMax` IS THE DIAL, and 4.6 is a look-at-it number rather than a derived one** --
  it is under every current free lunge except the finisher's. Raise it, or give the ordinary
  strikes their own, the day there IS a flying-kick clip: *"unless I'll make an animation for an
  actual launch"* is exactly the condition under which a long lunge stops reading as a bug.
- **A SHOVE IS A DISTANCE *AND* A DURATION, AND ONE DRAG SETS BOTH (m71, `K.shoveDrag`).**
  *"When I hit them like melee and stuff, or even shots, I want there to be like a subtle kickback
  -- even if they're not flying through the air -- so it feels like a more dramatic effect."*
  **THE MAGNITUDE WAS NEVER THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS WHY RAISING `knock` WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG
  MOVE.** m37 gave every blow a shove and the impulse is real -- a fist on the warrior is
  `knock` 4.2 x power .45 = **1.89 m/s** -- and `bodyFly` spent it at `knockDrag` 5.5, which is
  `v/k` metres with a `1/k` time constant:
      old   drag 5.5   fist 0.34 m over 0.18 s   rapid bolt 0.27 m   near-fling 0.53 m
      new   drag 2.2   fist 0.86 m over 0.45 s              0.69 m               1.32 m
  A third of a body-width, over a fifth of a second, is a TWITCH -- on a phone it is
  indistinguishable from the body not moving at all, which is exactly the report. **The same
  impulse at 2.2 travels 2.5x as far and takes 2.5x as long**, and nothing about how hard a blow
  hits, how much damage it does or where `fling` sits moved. **A distance you can see and a
  duration you can see are the same number in disguise**; when a motion reads as nothing, check
  the drag before the launch.
  **AND IT CANNOT SHARE `knockDrag`, BECAUSE THAT NUMBER HAS A SECOND JOB.** The same constant
  scrubs a FLUNG body along the ground after it lands, so halving it would double every skid
  as well -- a change nobody asked for, and the `chargeGoH` lesson at m27 one constant over.
  **THE TEST IS THE STATE RATHER THAN A FLAG, BECAUSE THE STATE *IS* THE FACT**: `hit` and
  `block` mean he is on his feet reacting to a blow, `down`/`up` mean he is on the floor. No
  field to set at the blow and nothing for a future shove site to forget.
  **AND KEYING ON IT CUTS THE TAIL FOR FREE**, which a flag would not have. The warrior's hit
  state is 1.0 s and the shove would take 1.65 s to reach `bodyFly`'s 0.05 m/s floor -- so the
  reaction ending flips the drag back to 5.5 and the 0.21 m/s left over dies in 4 cm, instead of
  a man walking away still drifting.
  **THE FLING IS STILL PLAINLY A DIFFERENT EVENT.** The hardest blow that does NOT launch a
  warrior is just under `fling` .70, which is 1.32 m of stagger against a fling's `flyV` 24 m/s
  -- so "knocked back" and "sent flying" are not two points on one curve you have to compare.
  **AND THE WHOOSH IS DELIBERATELY STILL SILENT.** `BODYSND.whoosh.at` is 5 m/s and the biggest
  shove is 3.2, so a stagger makes no air noise -- which is right: it is a man being moved, not
  a man being thrown. `mel.FOE.shoveDrag = 5.5` is the one word back to m70.
  **WHAT IS NOT DONE, AND IS THE NEXT LEVER IF THIS STILL READS FLAT: a melee hit does not
  flash the body.** `bodyFlash` exists (m39) and is called from exactly one place -- the bolt's
  impact swarm -- so a shot lights the mesh up and a punch does not, although his sentence names
  both. One line in `dummyBlow` would do it (`bodyFlash` takes a `max`, so it cannot double with
  the bolt's own), and it is left out here so the kickback can be judged on its own.
- **THE CLANG LAYER IS A LAYER, SO IT HAS TO SIT *UNDER* SOMETHING (m71, `HITSND.hard.ring.g`).**
  *"I'm thinking we turned down the metal clang sound effect. It's just kind of loud -- and I'm
  wearing headphones so it's extra loud -- but maybe tone that down a little bit so it works in
  conjunction with the other noises."* .52 -> .30. m64's whole argument is that the ring is what
  the blow lands ON and the hit bank is the BLOW, **so the ring is the one of the two that must
  never be the loudest thing in the mix** -- at .52 against `hard.g` .98 it was over half the
  impact it is supposed to be a detail of, and against m59's `cut`/`dec` envelope (which made
  every impact start AT its peak) the two arrived together and fought. Nothing else moved: the
  hit bank, the grunt and the plasma impact are untouched, so this is one variable.
  **AND IT IS THE ONLY DIAL, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS ONE LINE.** `ring` is on the KIND's row, read
  by all three of its callers (the melee connect, a bolt landing on a man, and the warrior's
  chest thump), so they cannot disagree about how loud a ring is -- and the flesh row has no
  `ring` at all, so a drunk in a coat was never in this conversation.
- **A RAPID ROUND WAS THE LEAST ACCURATE THING IN THE GAME, AND ITS PICTURE IS WHY (m70,
  `WEAP.autoR`).** *"The impact noise from the rapid fire blaster doesn't quite play the same
  sound as the charge blaster. Obviously the charge should be more intense, but I feel like
  they're maybe doing different stuff -- it's just kind of this pitter patter thing, it doesn't
  really feel like you're fully hitting him."* **His instinct was right and it is not a mix
  problem.** m56 tied the in-flight test to the visible BALL, which is exactly right for a
  charge shot -- the ball IS the thing, so what you see is what you hit -- and a rapid round's
  ball is small ON PURPOSE:
      full charge   ball 1.90 across  ->  .95 + warrior .46  =  **1.41 m** of forgiveness
      rapid round   ball 0.68         ->  .34 + .46          =  **0.80 m**, 43% less
  So a stream aimed at a man passes wide of him far more often than a cannonball does, flies on,
  and dies on the tarmac behind him -- **which plays the `plasma` bank rather than `pbody`, and
  does no damage.** That is "not the same sound" LITERALLY: a good fraction of the time it is a
  different bank, because a good fraction of the time you are not hitting him. `autoR` .60 puts
  it at 1.06 m, between a fumble and a full charge.
  **AND IT IS NOT m56's CORRIDOR COMING BACK.** That was `size * .5 + blast` = 4.01 m swept down
  a sixty-metre shot, with no impact to measure from; this is one round's own body, a quarter of
  that, and the full charge is untouched at 1.41. **The ball stays the picture for everything
  that HAS a meaningful ball; a round whose picture is a tracer needs its own number.**
- **AND NINE IMPACTS A SECOND WITH A 0.27 s TAIL ARE ALWAYS THREE DEEP (m70, `PUNCH.autoTail`).**
  The other half of "pitter patter", and it is not that each round is quiet -- measured, a rapid
  impact is already **77% of a full charge's gain**. It is that `PUNCH.dec` .17 stops at
  `dec * 1.6` = **.272 s** against a round every `WEAP.autoRate` .11, so **2.5 impacts overlap at
  all times**: the tails sum into a continuous wash and not one of the ATTACKS stands out of it.
  **No round has anywhere to land.**
      tail was   0.272 s  ->  2.5 deep
      tail now   0.109 s  ->  0.99 deep
  **THE TAIL IS DERIVED FROM THE ROUND INTERVAL, NOT PICKED.** `autoRate * .62` is one impact per
  round BY CONSTRUCTION and follows if the fire rate is ever retuned; a number typed here would
  silently stop fitting the first time `autoRate` moved. `autoG` 1.14 lifts the PEAK to pay for
  the shorter tail, which is the same trade `cut` makes at m59 -- an impact is a transient, and
  what carries it is the front, not the length.
  **AND `pbody` IS TWO FILES AT NINE A SECOND**, which is a recognisable loop inside a second --
  m62 wrote that rule about seven grunts and it had never been applied here. `autoJit` .09.
- **A LAYER THAT SAYS "PLATE" ONCE IS WEIGHT; NINE A SECOND IS A SECOND DRUM (m70,
  `HITSND.ringGap`).** m64's ring is a deliberate blow's second source, and under rapid fire it
  fired on **every round** -- so two short percussive layers at 9 Hz each, which is rain rather
  than an impact. It is thinned to `ringGap` .30 under auto and untouched everywhere else: a
  charge shot, a fist and a hammer all still ring on every blow.
  **ITS OWN INTERVAL RATHER THAN `SFX.gap`**, because what is wrong here is musical and not a
  voice budget -- .045 would let all nine through and changing the global would thin every clang
  in the game. And `thin` is a parameter rather than a read of the mode, so the one caller that
  knows it is a stream is the one that asks for it.
- **AND THE FOOTSTEPS WERE PLAYING THROUGH THE ROLL, WHICH IS WHERE `stepFeet` IS CALLED (m70).**
  *"The footsteps are way better. Now we need to make sure when he rolls he's not playing
  footsteps, because it currently is."* `stepFeet` is the FIRST line of `stepPlayer`, above the
  branch that owns the body -- so a roll, a lunge, a dash and a get-up all covered ground and all
  counted footfalls, and a dodge roll at `MELEE.rollV` is the fastest of them.
  **THE GAIT IS THE ONLY THING WITH FEET IN IT.** Everything in that list is a clip of a man
  doing something that is not walking, which is `bodyFeet`'s own `d.st !== 'idle'` test pointed
  at the player -- and it is the fourth time in this file that "when a feature does something
  wrong, check WHERE it is called before what it does".
  **The phase carries through rather than being zeroed**, so the first step out of a roll is not
  instant -- m64's own rule, which is exactly what a reset here would have broken.

- **A LOOPING CLIP THAT TRAVELS TELEPORTS AT ITS LOOP POINT (m69, `deDrift`).** *"He's like
  walking, most of his locomotion and animations go well, but then every now and again he'll walk
  to the side and then teleport like 5 feet back to where he was. I don't know what causes this,
  if it's an animation that's unaligned or what."* **It is the animation, and it is not
  alignment** -- it is baked root travel in the two clips the circle plays. Read straight out of
  his file, net Hips drift from the first key to the last, in armature units:
      standing_walk_forward   0.0      standing_walk_left    44.4   -> 1.06 m
      standing_run_forward    0.0      standing_walk_right   51.4   -> 1.23 m
      standing_walk_back      0.0      (and the drunks' unused strafes: 110 to 117)
  m35's note says *"THE CLIPS ANIMATE IN PLACE"* -- that was measured on the ANTENNA ALIEN and
  written under his section, and it was never true of the warrior's two strafes. **`K.strafe` and
  `K.strafeR` are `standing_walk_left/right`**, they are what `foeMove` plays while he CIRCLES,
  and `bodyLoops` correctly makes them LOOP: so the cycle carries him 1.2 m sideways and the wrap
  snaps him back. Four feet, intermittently, exactly as described. Nothing to do with a collider,
  a state machine or `bodySep`.
  **THE DRIFT IS REMOVED, NOT THE MOTION -- WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT A FREEZE.** Pinning X and Z at
  the first key is the obvious fix and it would take the lateral hip sway out of every gait in
  the game along with it: the GOOD clips carry 1.9 to 2.3 units of it and that sway IS the walk.
  What is subtracted is the LINEAR RAMP from the first key to the last, so the clip starts and
  ends in the same place BY CONSTRUCTION and everything else survives. **No threshold to pick**,
  which matters -- a magic number here would have had to separate 2.3 from 44.4 by taste.
  **AND Y IS NEVER TOUCHED.** The Hips translation is the body's height off the ground and every
  crouch, landing and fall in the set uses it -- this file's own standing rule about why that one
  position track is kept when all the others are stripped.
  **A `ONCE` CLIP THAT TRAVELS IS FINE AND MUST BE LEFT ALONE.** `Shoulder_Hit_And_Fall` drifts
  26.7 units and `Getting_Up` 26.5, which is a man falling forwards and getting back up -- there
  is no loop point for it to snap at, and de-drifting those would make him fall straight down.
  So the pass is over `bodyLoops(K)`, the set the game already derives for exactly this question,
  rather than over a second list to keep in step.
  **ONCE PER KIND, NOT PER BODY.** `bodyProto` runs once and every copy of that kind shares the
  clip objects, so three warriors cannot de-drift the same track three times. Doing it in
  `bodySpawn` would have subtracted the ramp once per man.
  **AND `values` IS CLONED BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN.** GLTFLoader resolves an accessor once and
  caches it, so two tracks can hold the same `Float32Array` -- `normaliseClips` already clones
  `times` for that reason a few dozen lines up, and this is the same landmine one array over.
  **VERIFIED BY RUNNING THE SHIPPED ARITHMETIC OVER THE REAL TRACKS**, with the clean clips as
  the control, which is the half that says the fix is not also a bug:
      clip                    net before   net after   X-sway before / after
      standing_walk_left           44.38      0.0000     44.38 / 2.77   <- what is left is SWAY
      standing_walk_right          51.41      0.0000     51.41 / 3.39
      standing_walk_forward         0.00      0.0000      2.33 / 2.33   <- provably a NO-OP
      standing_run_forward          0.00      0.0000      1.89 / 1.89
  **AND THE PLAYER'S OWN EXPORT MEASURES CLEAN**, so this is not applied to him: every looping
  clip he has drifts under 0.5 units, and the four that drift at all (`landing_soft` 4.5,
  `Standing_Melee_Attack_360_High` 10.4) are `ONCE` clips at one to fourteen centimetres.
  `deDrift` is general and is there the day one of his re-exports is not.
  **WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE NEXT MIXAMO CLIP** is the part worth keeping: an "in place" export
  is a CHECKBOX, and the strafes in this file were not exported with it ticked. `npm run clips`
  is where a net-drift column belongs the next time that tool is touched -- until then, the one
  thing that makes this class of bug invisible is that it looks like a physics or collider fault
  and is neither.

- **THE SOUND RAN AHEAD OF THE FEET, AND THIRTEEN MEN SHARED ONE KEY (m68, `strideOf`,
  `STEP.near`).** *"The footsteps are insane. I can't tell if it's coming from my guy or all the
  other guys but they're just constantly going and it just sounds like tap dancing."* Two causes,
  and the second is why he could not tell whose they were.
  **1. m64's STRIDE IS ONLY TRUE WHILE THE CLIP PLAYS AT `sp / ref`, AND `tsHi` CLAMPS THAT.**
  That note's argument -- one cycle covers `duration * ref` METRES whatever the speed, because
  the speed cancels -- is exactly right and has a precondition nobody wrote down: it cancels
  through the TIME SCALE, and the time scale is `clamp(sp / ref, tsLo, tsHi)`. Wherever the clamp
  bites the feet slow down and the sound does not. Tabled against what is actually on screen:
      speed  band     ts     OLD/s   NEW/s   feet/s
        1.5  walk    1.60      3.5     2.3      2.3
        2.0  walk    1.60      4.7     2.3      2.3   <- TWICE his feet, for the whole walk band
        3.0  run     1.36      3.6     3.6      3.6   <- unclamped, and m64 was right here
        7.2  sprint  1.60      8.9     6.4      6.4
  **THE WALK BAND IS CLAMPED ACROSS ITS WHOLE RANGE**, which is the part I would not have
  guessed: `walk_fwd` is 1.417 s against a scaled `walkRef` of 0.60, so ANY real walking speed
  asks for more than 1.6x. Nearly every step he takes was in the broken half.
  **THE FIX IS THE SAME ARITHMETIC WITH THE REAL `ts` IN IT.** One cycle takes `duration / ts`
  seconds, so it covers `sp * duration / ts` metres -- and with `ts` unclamped that reduces to
  `duration * ref` exactly, so this GENERALISES m64 rather than replacing it. **Both halves now
  read one `ts`, so the foot and the sound cannot disagree by construction**, which is the only
  agreement worth having given that nothing in this container can hear the game.
  **SO WHAT IS MEASURED AT LOAD IS THE PAIR, NOT THE ANSWER.** `STEP.clip` holds `{d, r}` and the
  distance is worked out at the speed he is going. A stride is not a constant on a clamped clip.
  **2. AND `SFX.gap` TURNS THIRTEEN RHYTHMS INTO ONE STREAM.** It refuses two `foot` sounds
  inside 45 ms, so a street of amblers does not come out as thirteen sets of footsteps -- it
  comes out as ONE saturated key with no rhythm in it at all. **That is precisely why "whose are
  those" had no answer**: the interval nobody could hear a pattern in was the gap's, not anyone's
  stride. `SFX.near` could not fix it either -- it is a MIX rule that fades to nothing at 40 m,
  and a body at thirty metres was still spending voices and still spending the gap.
  **A HARD RANGE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM A FADE**: `STEP.near` 9 m is "is a man over there
  worth a voice at all", answered at the producer, and `npcG` .52 puts the ones that survive it
  behind him rather than beside him.
  **AND THERE IS A MASTER SWITCH, BECAUSE HE ASKED FOR ONE.** *"Either way we need to fix it or
  just get rid of it altogether."* `mel.STEP.on = 0` is the one word and `mel.STEP.npc = 0` keeps
  his and drops the other thirteen -- so the A/B is on the phone rather than in a build.
  **THE BANK IS A STAND-IN AND IS MARKED AS ONE.** *"I'll put in a different footsteps sound."*
  `SFX.files.foot` points at the two BODY-IMPACT recordings, which is a man arriving flat -- six
  of those a second is a drum rather than a stride whatever the rate is. Its own key is what
  makes the swap one line.
- **AND NOTHING IN THE TRIGGER BLOCK HAD A `busy` GATE AT ALL (m68, `triggerStop`).** *"When I'm
  shooting and then I roll, he needs to stop shooting -- right now he just continues shooting
  while he rolls. It looks weird."* The guard has one, the square-up has one, and the blaster's
  trigger never did: a wound shot went on winding and a rapid-fire hold went on firing ROUNDS out
  of a man rolling along the floor.
  **CLEARING ON THE WAY IN IS NOT ENOUGH, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS.** The thumb is
  still up there, so the very next frame walks straight back through `padUp` and arms again
  mid-roll. It takes both: `rollGo` stands it down, and the block refuses to run while the body
  is not his.
  **`p.roll` AND `p.knock`, NOT `!p.grounded`.** Shooting out of a jump is fine and always was;
  what is wrong is shooting out of a move that owns the body. Copying the guard's `busy` verbatim
  would have taken the air with it.
  **AND A ROLL COSTS YOU THE CHARGE**, which is the trade rather than an oversight: you spent the
  move to go somewhere.
  **`triggerStop` IS ONE FUNCTION BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY THREE COPIES WAITING TO HAPPEN.** The
  guard spelt the five assignments out inline; the roll and the knock-down want the identical
  thing, and `chargeStop()` is the one of the five that is easy to forget -- a rising synth hum
  nobody stops plays for the rest of the session.

- **THE m64 DEPLOY FAILED, AND A PAGES RUN IS A LINK IN THE CHAIN NOBODY WAS WATCHING (m67).**
  *"My game is stuck on m63."* He was on m63 and the repo was on m66, and the gap is not his cache
  alone. Read off the runs:
      m63  run 75  **success**  23:52   <- the last build that actually reached the server
      m64  run 76  **FAILURE**  00:00   <- deployed nothing
      m65  run 77  success      00:02
      m66  run 78  success      00:08
  **"PUSHED" AND "LIVE" ARE TWO DIFFERENT FACTS AND THIS FILE ONLY EVER CHECKED THE FIRST.** The
  loop here ends at `git push` and reports the build number, which is right for the ninety-odd
  builds where the deploy succeeds and is exactly wrong for the one where it does not -- **and
  from where he is standing a failed deploy, a ten-minute Pages cache and a bug that did not fix
  anything are all the same picture**, which is the same sentence `npm run bump` exists under.
  **SO THE CHECK IS ONE CALL AND IT COSTS NOTHING:** after a push, read the newest
  `pages build and deployment` run for that head sha and say so if it is not green. It is NOT a
  CI gate -- the "there must not be one" note above is about a workflow that FAILS on every push
  and trains everybody to ignore a red X; this is reading the one run GitHub creates by itself.
  **AND A QUEUED RUN IS NOT A SHIPPED BUILD.** m66's run was still `in_progress` when this was
  looked at, so "shipped unverified -- m66" was true of the repo and not yet true of the phone.
  Say which, when it matters.
- **BEING KNOCKED DOWN, AND THE EXPORT ALREADY HAD TWO OF THE THREE BEATS (m67, `HURT`,
  `p.knock`).** *"When the orcs hit you, you fly through the air a little bit and land on the
  ground and then get up."* Read straight out of the file -- 24 clips, and what is in there is
  `in_air` (a real float) and `landing_hard` (a real man hitting the ground and pushing back up
  off it, 1.50 s authored). **What there is NO clip for is LYING there**, so there is no lying
  beat: the arc runs straight into the hard landing and that IS the get-up. `HURT.down`/`up` are
  the hooks, written the way `CLIPS.block` and the hick's empty pose names are -- **the STATE runs
  either way and naming a clip later adds no branch**, which is the whole return on keeping the
  two separate.
  **THE APEX IS THE NUMBER AND `vy` IS DERIVED FROM IT**, m21's rule: a velocity picked by eye is
  a height nobody chose. `hi` .78 at `MOVE.g` 20 is 5.59 m/s up and 0.56 s of air, and `back` 7.6
  against `airDrag` integrates to **about four metres** -- `v0(1-e^-kT)/k` with k = .25, not
  `back * T`, which is the m146 arithmetic one repo over (a launch speed means nothing without
  the clock and the drag beside it).
  **AND IT IS SET, NOT ADDED.** Every other shove in `playerHurt` is `+=` on whatever he was
  already doing, which is right for a nudge and wrong for a solved arc -- added to a sprint it
  lands him somewhere nobody chose.
  **IT ALWAYS LANDS HARD, rather than hoping the arc clears `MOVE.hardLand`.** Those are two
  unrelated numbers -- the apex is chosen for how it READS and the threshold is about falls -- so
  coupling them means retuning one silently changes the other. At 5.59 m/s it would have failed
  the 8.0 test and landed SOFT, which is the picture this whole build exists to avoid.
  **AND `landing_hard` PLAYS AT ITS OWN LENGTH.** `MOVE.landHard` 1.15 compresses a 1.50 s clip
  to x1.30, which is right for a landing you are running out of and is m37's "too fast to read is
  the same reaction every time" for a get-up. `HURT.land` is 1.50, so x1.0.
  **A GET-UP IS NOT CANCELLABLE, WHICH `landFree` WOULD OTHERWISE MAKE IT.** That early-out exists
  so an ordinary landing does not cost you a step you were already taking; applied here, one nudge
  of the stick and the get-up is never once seen -- m8's lesson about a state that cuts its own
  clip short, arriving from the other side. `meleeGo` and `rollGo` refuse to start out of one too.
  **ONE FLAG FOR BOTH HALVES.** `p.knock` is set at the launch and cleared where the landing ends,
  so the flight and the get-up are one move rather than two states to keep in step -- and every
  gate (no steering, no early-out, land hard, no strike, no roll) reads that one thing.
  **A GUARD IS WHAT KEEPS HIM ON HIS FEET**, which is the third thing blocking now buys on top of
  the damage and the shove. **And `again` 1.1 is what stops three orcs holding him on the floor**
  -- a blow inside that window still hurts and still shoves, it just does not re-launch, which is
  `d.cool`'s own rule pointed at the player. Being unable to move is the least fun state in any
  game and this file already says so about the stun.
  **AND A BLOW TAKEN WHILE HE IS DOWN DOES NOT HOP HIM BACK OFF THE FLOOR** -- the shove branch's
  `if (p.grounded) p.vel.y = up` would otherwise interrupt a get-up with a little jump, which
  reads as a glitch and not as a second hit.
  **`whooshSnd` CAME OUT OF `bodyWhoosh`, `bumpSnd`'s own m66 refactor one event over.** A man
  thrown through the air and a BODY thrown through the air must not be two different sounds; the
  landing thump was already shared and this is the other half. **`p.knockCool` and `p.knock` are
  initialised in the player object**, because `undefined -= dt` is NaN and a NaN cooldown is a
  player who can never be knocked down again -- silent, and invisible to both gates. m63's
  `d.bumpT` lesson, and the reason it is checked every time now.
  **THE CHIP SAYS `KNOCKED` IN THE AIR AND `getup` ON THE GROUND**, because "it never fired" and
  "it fired and I could not tell which half I was in" are opposite bugs and one picture from a
  phone. `mel.hurt()` knocks him down from the console, `mel.hurt(12, 0)` is the old plain shove,
  and `mel.HURT` is live.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED**: whether four metres and 0.56 s read as *"a little bit"* is the
  look-at-it half and belongs on the phone -- `hi`, `back` and `land` are the three dials. And
  `npm run sim` has no case for this; the knock-down is arithmetic over the shipped `integrate`
  and could have one, which is a stated gap rather than a claim.

- **A SOUND KNOWS WHERE IT HAPPENED, AND THAT BELONGS IN `snd` (m66, `SFX.near`).** *"Maybe the
  footsteps on them as well, but they probably -- depending how far away from you they are, the
  volume is quieter."* Right, and it is the whole reason this goes in `snd` rather than at the
  call sites: **a body sound is emitted from ten places now** (the grunt, the melee hit, the ring,
  the bolt on a man, two taunt beats, the whoosh, the bump and both footstep callers) and a rule
  every producer has to remember is not a rule. One optional `{ x, z }` on the options object,
  absent for anything that happens to the player himself, and the gain is multiplied on the way
  past. `mel.SFX.near` is live.
  **THE DISTANCE IS CHECKED FIRST, BEFORE THE VOICE CAP AND BEFORE THE PER-KEY GAP.** A warrior
  thirty metres away being punched by another warrior must not take one of `SFX.max` voices and
  must not spend `SFX.gap` on the `hit` key -- if it did, a brawl across the street would silence
  the fight you are standing in, which is exactly backwards. Past `out` it returns before
  touching either.
  **AND IT IS A SMOOTHSTEP TO ZERO, NOT AN INVERSE SQUARE.** A physical falloff is 1/d and never
  actually reaches zero, so a hundred bodies at a hundred metres each contribute a little and the
  mix turns to mud; `full` (7 m) is "as loud as it gets" and `out` (40 m) is silence, which is a
  decision about the MIX rather than about acoustics. No `PannerNode` either: this is one gain
  multiply against a whole spatial audio graph, and nothing in here is stereo-positioned.
- **HIS LANDING IS THE SAME IMPACT A BODY'S IS (m66, `bumpSnd`, `BODYSND.drop.me`).** *"He said
  the bank -- for it is still sitting right there for the hero. I'm assuming we could do it for
  his landing as well."* `bodyBump` was already the one rule for a body arriving; the half that
  is genuinely shared is the SOUND, so `bumpSnd(v, x, z)` came out of it and `bodyBump` kept the
  cooldown and the position lookup, which are the body's own business. `integrate` calls it where
  `p.fallV` is already measured -- **the one frame `landed` is set**, so there is no second test
  for "is he on the ground" to drift from the first.
  **`me` .72 IS WHY HE IS NOT A SACK.** A man landing on his feet absorbs it; a body arriving flat
  does not, and the same recording at the same gain would make every jump sound like somebody
  being dropped. One multiplier rather than a second table, so retuning `drop` moves both.
- **AND THEIR FOOTSTEPS ARE m64'S ARITHMETIC ON THEIR OWN CLIPS (m66, `bodyStride`, `bodyFeet`).**
  A stride is `duration * ref / perCycle` metres -- how far one authored cycle carries a body
  whatever rate it is played at -- so an NPC needed no new idea, only the kind's own two clips and
  two refs. **Cached on the KIND**, because it is a fact about the EXPORT and not about the man:
  three warriors share one measurement.
  **THE CROSSOVER NEEDS NO CONSTANT**, because each kind already carries its own two reference
  speeds: midway between `walkRef` and `runRef` is the point the gait blend is halfway across, by
  construction, and a typed threshold would be a third number to keep in step with two that
  already exist.
  **A KIND WITH NO WALK CLIP IS SILENT AND THAT IS CORRECT.** The officer never moves; `K.clips.walk`
  being absent is the honest test for it, not a flag to remember to set.
  **AND `d.st !== 'idle'` IS DOING REAL WORK.** `idle` is the umbrella every AI state lives under;
  `hit`, `down`, `up`, `taunt` and `block` are not walking -- and a man being SHOVED along the
  ground covers distance without taking a step, which would otherwise read as him jogging while
  unconscious. That distance already has its own sound in `bodyBump`.
  **THE PHASE IS KEPT, NEVER ZEROED, on both bodies and the player.** Resetting it on a stop makes
  the first step of every start instant, so a jiggled stick is a burst of footfalls -- which is the
  push cycle's own lesson one repo over, where a released thumb re-seeding the stroke turned a
  rhythm into four sounds.

- **A CHARGE TOPPING OUT IS NOT AN IMPACT (m65, `HCHG.snd`, `SFX.files.ready`).** *"As it
  currently is, when you charge the melee it makes a metal clang noise and I don't really like
  that -- it's confusing, it seems like you hit something. There's another one we used, I don't
  know if it was a ping, or there's also a bunch in the other game robits like a power up
  noise."* He is describing a **vocabulary** error and not a mix one, which is the same shape as
  m55's plasma-bolt-is-not-a-detonation: the clang is the sound of a blow landing, so playing it
  when nothing has been hit says the wrong thing however quiet it is. m64 made that worse by
  putting a real clang on every actual blow, so the two became the same noise.
  **`powerup_01.mp3`, BORROWED FROM `robits/audio`** the way the swooshes and clangs already
  were. **And it is played from its PEAK (`cut: 1`), which is what makes a RISE usable as an
  ARRIVAL** -- Shredworld turned this exact file down for the blaster's charge HUM because it is
  a one-shot rise and a hum has to loop, which is the opposite requirement. Here the EVENT is
  the moment the rise lands, so `e.p` throws the wind-up away and leaves the ding. m59's
  mechanism doing the job it was built for.
  **THE WHOLE SHAPE IS ON `HCHG` NOW**, not spelt at the call site, so `mel.HCHG.snd = 'lock'`
  is the A/B to the metal ping he also named and `'clang'` is the one word back.
- **AND A TAUNT MAKES A NOISE (m65, `K.tauntSnd`).** *"When the warrior beats his chest we could
  use those same sound effects for that as well. I'll probably make custom orc noises for that,
  but for the sound of the chest beat."*
  **KEYED ON THE CLIP NAME, ON THE KIND'S OWN TABLE.** A chest thump and a battlecry are two
  different events and **the only thing that separates them IS which clip is playing** -- so
  this is the one place in this file where a name test is the honest test rather than a shortcut
  for a structural one (`stripPoses`' rule, met from the other side). A taunt with no row is
  silent, which is what a new one should be until somebody says what it sounds like.
      standing_taunt_chest_thump   `hit`, TWICE, heavy and low, plus the armour ring
      standing_taunt_battlecry     `grunt`, once -- the orc bank, which is what a bark is
  **`at` IS WHERE IN THE CLIP, AS FRACTIONS, AND THE LOOP IS A `while`** -- so a slow frame that
  steps past two beats fires both rather than losing one, which a per-frame `if` would.
  `d.tauntN` is how many have gone and is reset where the taunt starts.
  **BOTH ARE STAND-INS AND BOTH ARE MARKED**, the way `soft` and `drop` were before his own
  recordings landed: point the keys at files and nothing else moves.
  **AND THE FRACTIONS ARE A GUESS THAT WANTS A LOOK ON THE PHONE.** A strike has `MELEE.at` --
  an authored contact frame to measure against -- and a taunt has nothing of the kind, so .30
  and .50 are where two chest beats plausibly fall in a clip and not a measurement. Stated
  rather than dressed up; `mel.FOE.tauntSnd` is live.
  **THE TAUNT IS ONE KNOCK-DOWN IN FOUR** (`FOE.taunt` .25) and only on the way back up, so it
  takes a few fights to hear. That is the existing rule, not a new one.

- **THE CLANG IS A LAYER, NOT AN ALTERNATIVE -- AND THAT IS THE THIRD ANSWER (m64, `hitRing`).**
  *"I'm thinking the metal clang in addition to what we're using, for both the blaster and the
  melee."* m57 made it the armoured body's SOUND, m63 replaced it with his own recordings, and
  **ADDITION is what he actually wanted both times**: the hit bank is the BLOW and the ring is
  what the blow lands ON, so they are two sources and one event -- exactly the shape the grunt
  already has at m62, and not the m27 duplicate, which was two voices describing one thing.
  **IT IS STILL A FACT ABOUT THE MAN.** The ring rides `HITSND.hard.ring`, so plate rings and a
  drunk in a coat does not, and giving a body one is a field on his row. m57's own distinction
  survives -- what changed is that it is now carried by a LAYER instead of by a different file.
  Quieter and higher than the clang ever was alone, because it is no longer doing the impact.
  **AND `dummyHit` RETURNS THE BODY NOW, NOT A FLAG.** The blaster half of his sentence needed
  to know WHAT the bolt hit in order to ask whether that man rings -- which is the identical
  one-word change `strikeSweep` needed at m57, for the identical reason. It still loops them
  ALL (m36's `hitAll`), and every caller tested it for truth rather than comparing it to 1, so
  returning the man cost nothing. `b.onMan` carries the body rather than a 1.
- **HIS FOOTSTEPS, AND THE STRIDE IS A DISTANCE THE CLIP ALREADY DECIDED (m64, `STEP`,
  `stepFeet`).** *"I think his footsteps, we could use the two ground sound effects that I just
  made, for each footstep."*
  **A FOOTSTEP IS EVERY N METRES, NOT EVERY N SECONDS**, and that is the whole reason this stays
  in sync with nothing to keep in step. `rigAnim` time-scales every locomotion clip by
  `speed / ref`, so one cycle takes `duration * ref / speed` seconds and therefore covers
  **`duration * ref` METRES whatever speed he is going** -- the speed cancels. Two footfalls to
  a cycle, so the stride is half of that, and the accumulator does the rest.
      a TIMER would be right at exactly one speed and wrong at every other
      a PHASE read off the mixer would be a second clock to keep in step with the clip's own,
      which is the m59 push-scrape lesson one game over
  **AND THE THREE STRIDES ARE COMPUTED AT LOAD FROM THE REAL DURATIONS AND THE SCALED REFS**, in
  `buildRig` where both are known -- so a re-export at a different length, or another change to
  `RIG.height`, moves them with nothing edited. They are printed at boot beside the clip list.
  **THE PHASE IS KEPT WHILE HE STANDS STILL.** Zeroing it makes the first step of every start
  instant, so a jiggled stick is a burst of footfalls; carried, he simply resumes.
  **LEFT AND RIGHT ALTERNATE BY A SHADE OF PITCH**, plus jitter, because two identical footfalls
  in a row read as a loop rather than as a man -- the grunt's own argument at m62.
  **ITS OWN KEY ON THE SAME TWO FILES.** A footstep must not gate out a body hitting the ground
  through `SFX.last`'s per-key gap, and either wants re-pointing alone. Bytes off the HTTP
  cache; one extra decode on a short file.
  **THE PLAYER ONLY, WHICH IS WHAT HE ASKED FOR AND IS ALSO THE CHEAP HALF.** Thirteen bodies
  with footsteps is thirteen more voices in a fight; `stepFeet` reads `player` directly and
  giving the NPCs the same thing would want the accumulator on the body, not a second function.
  **AND HIS OWN LANDING IS STILL SILENT** -- `MOVE.landSoft`/`landHard` fire no sound at all, and
  the bank for it is now sitting right there. Not done because he did not ask; stated so it is
  not re-discovered.

- **HIS HIT BANK, AND THREE STAND-INS DISCHARGED AT ONCE (m63, `audio/hit_sounds`).** *"The
  first like three are for when the melee connects, then there's two for when the plasma cannon
  actually hits the character, and the last two are for when they fly into the air and then hit
  a wall or another character or the ground -- play one of these two for every connection
  point, so if they bounce or hit a wall and then hit the ground."* **The filenames carry the
  split and the game reads it exactly as he wrote it**, three keys, no guessing.
      hit_sound_01..03          -> `hit`    the melee connect
      hit_sound_plasma_01/02    -> `pbody`  the bolt landing ON a man
      hit_sound_gound_01,
      hit_sound_ground_02       -> `drop`   every impact a flying body makes
  **THE FILENAMES ARE LEFT EXACTLY AS UPLOADED, `gound` AND ALL.** A tidy-up here is a 404 the
  next time he drops the same files in, and `A()` keys on the path -- Shredworld's own rule
  about `.mp4` in the middle of a skateboard filename.
  **AND THREE NUMBERS THAT ONLY EXISTED TO RESCUE A STAND-IN WENT WITH THEM.** `soft`'s `r` .55
  and `dur` .13, and `drop`'s `r` .52 and `dur` .18, were what made `box_break_01` sound
  remotely like a body; his recordings ARE the thing, so they play at their own rate and their
  own length. **A number that exists to rescue a stand-in has to go when the stand-in does**, or
  the fix for one file becomes a bug in the next -- m58 paid for this once on the `dur` cap.
  **BOTH `HITSND` ROWS NAME THE SAME BANK NOW, WHICH REOPENS m57 DELIBERATELY.** That build put
  `clang` on the warrior because *"the clang and the clink is for people with armour"*, and
  these three are recordings of a melee landing with no exception named. So the armoured/flesh
  distinction stops being two FILES and becomes WEIGHT and PITCH on one set -- the metal clangs'
  own rule, where three car tiers are told apart by pitch rather than by three recordings. The
  rows are `hard` and `soft` rather than `clang` and `soft`, because a row called `clang` that
  does not play a clang is a comment describing an intent the code cannot express.
  `metal_clang_01..03` stay loaded, so `mel.snd('clang')` is the A/B and the hammer's top-out
  ring is untouched.
  **AND THE BOLT PICKS A BANK RATHER THAN A GAIN.** `b.onMan` has told those two events apart
  since m58 and was only choosing how loud; it chooses the recording now. A near miss into the
  wall behind him still lands on the `plasma` bank, because that is what an area weapon IS and
  it must not go silent.
- **A BODY IN THE AIR IS A PROJECTILE (m63, `FLYHIT`, `bodyBump`).** *"I do think we should make
  enemies be able to fly there and hit other enemies. Knock them down, or at least hit them back
  a little bit."*
  **IT NEEDED NO DAMAGE PATH AND NO SECOND BRAIN.** The man he lands on goes through
  `dummyBlow`, which is the one function a fist, a mace and a bolt all already reach -- so the
  reaction clip, the grunt, the shove, the health and the knock-down are written, and **a man
  knocked down hard enough is a flyer in his own right, so the CHAIN falls out of it** rather
  than being coded. That is `d.K`'s own dividend, three builds along.
  **THE POWER COMES FROM THE IMPACT SPEED**, which is the difference between "knock them down"
  and "hit them back a little": `FOE.fling` .70 is crossed around 14 m/s, so a full fling (24
  m/s) bowls the next man over and a light knock merely staggers him -- one curve, both of his
  outcomes, nothing typed per case.
  **THE STRUCK BODY'S OWN `K.cool` IS WHAT STOPS IT FIRING EVERY FRAME** they overlap, so this
  needed no state of its own; `dummyHit` has skipped bodies on cool since m56 and the same field
  does the work here. `cost` is what the flyer pays, or one fling scythes a whole street.
  **AND A WALL IS A REAL BOUNCE, WITH THE NORMAL COMING FOR FREE.** `resolveBoxes` returns
  whether it pushed, and **the push itself IS the surface normal** -- so only the component going
  INTO the wall is reflected and what he had ALONG it he keeps. A slide along a shopfront costs
  nothing and a square hit comes back off it, which is Shredworld's `SK8.bounce` rule one body
  over and is exactly the *"if they bounce"* he asked for.
  **ONE `bodyBump`, SO THREE CONNECTION POINTS CANNOT BECOME THREE RULES.** Its floor is a SPEED
  (a man scrubbed along the floor or grinding down a wall must not thump) and its `cool` is the
  same floor in TIME, **per body rather than per key** -- two men landing together are two
  impacts and one man scraping a wall is not, which `SFX.last`'s global gap gets backwards.
  **`d.bumpT` HAD TO BE INITIALISED IN `bodySpawn`.** `undefined -= dt` is NaN, and a NaN clock
  is a body that never bumps again -- silent, and invisible to both gates.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED**: the flyer-into-body test is horizontal with a height gate, so a body
  sailing over another one's head at a steep angle may still clip him; and a body knocked into
  the PLAYER does nothing, because `playerHurt` is a separate path and he did not ask for it.
  Both stated rather than hidden. `mel.FLYHIT` is live.

- **A BODY MAKES THREE SOUNDS AND `HITSND` HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT ANY OF THEM (m62, `BODYSND`,
  `K.voice`, `bodyWhoosh`).** *"I added a sound effects folder for alien orc grunts, so when he
  gets hit or shot he plays these also. Also, when you launch them in the air it needs to play
  that swipe noise the character plays when he melees -- any time a body part moves fast we need
  to play one of those. And then I need a sound effect for when they hit the ground too."*
  **"ALSO" IS THE WORD THAT DECIDES THE SHAPE.** `HITSND` is the sound of the CONTACT, keyed on
  what the man is made of; a grunt is the sound of the MAN. Two sources, one event, so the voice
  sits BESIDE the impact rather than replacing it -- which is not the m27 duplicate, because
  that one was two voices describing the same physical thing.
      grunt    `K.voice` on the kind, the way `K.snd` is. Louder and lower the harder he was hit
      whoosh   the strikes' OWN swoosh, keyed on the body's SPEED and nothing else
      drop     the arrival, where `bodyFly` actually sets him down
  **THE VOICE GOES IN `dummyBlow`, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE EVERY BLOW ON A BODY REACHES** -- fist,
  mace, bolt and blast alike -- and `dummyHit` has already refused anyone inside `K.cool`, so it
  is exactly one grunt per blow with nothing new to gate. **Above the down-punt return on
  purpose**: kicking a man who is already on the floor is still hitting him.
  **THE RATE IS JITTERED.** Seven files heard a hundred times become recognisable, and a grunt
  that is always the same grunt reads as a sample rather than as a man -- which is this file's
  own "it always does the same thing" lesson, for the third time and on the audio side.
  **AND IT IS THE ORC'S.** The files are named for him and only `FOE` names the voice; the two
  drunks and the officer stay silent until there are recordings for them, which is **one word
  each** on their tables. `mel.snd('grunt')` plays one from the console.
  **THE WHOOSH IS KEYED ON SPEED, NOT ON WHICH BRANCH LAUNCHED HIM**, which is his sentence read
  literally and is also the only version with one threshold in it: `bodyWhoosh(d)` reads
  `hypot(vx, vy, vz)` and is called at each of the three places a launch velocity is set. A
  full-power KNOCK is 4.2 m/s and the smallest real launch is over 7, so `at` 5 keeps an ordinary
  jab silent and catches every punt and every fling with nothing typed per case. **And the pitch
  comes DOWN as the speed goes up** -- a big body moving fast is a lower sound than a fist, which
  is the metal clangs' own rule, where three car tiers are told apart by pitch and not by three
  recordings.
  **THE LANDING IS FIRED WHERE THE FLIGHT IS ACTUALLY ENDED**, in `bodyFly`, not on the state
  clock -- the GROUND is what stops a body and a timer drops him through whatever he was thrown
  onto (m35's own reason for making the flight ballistic in the first place). **The impact speed
  has to be read before `d.vy` is zeroed**, and `at` 3 is what stops a man being scrubbed ALONG
  the floor thumping on every frame that branch runs, because `d.vy <= 0` is true the whole time
  he is down.
  **`drop` IS A STAND-IN AND THE THIRD KEY POINTED AT `box_break_01`.** There is nothing on disk
  that is a body landing, any more than there was one for a body being hit -- so it is the dull
  break dropped an octave, cut to an instant and given `cut`/`dec`'s percussive envelope. **Its
  own key** so it can be re-pointed alone and cannot gate `thud` or `soft` through `SFX.last`;
  the bytes come off the HTTP cache and only the decode is paid again.
  **AND `audio/alien_orc_grunt_sounds` HAD TO GO INTO `bump.mjs`'s `DIRS`** -- `readdirSync` is
  not recursive, so a new asset folder is a new entry there or every file in it goes stale
  silently. **Fifth time**, after `models/buildings` (m25), `audio/plasma_sounds` (m58),
  `models/towers` (m60) and Shredworld's own.
  **WHAT IS UNVERIFIED**: whether a grunt over `soft`'s box break is muddy on the drunks is moot
  (they have no voice yet), and whether a grunt over `clang` is right on the warrior is a device
  question -- `mel.SFX` is live and `HITSND.clang.g` is the dial if the ring is now in the way.

- **A RINGING BLOW IS A FACT ABOUT THE MAN, NOT ABOUT THE WEAPON (m57, `HITSND`, `K.snd`).**
  *"When you hit regular characters that are like NPCs, I think it needs to be more of a [moan].
  It shouldn't make the clang or the clink, cause that's for people with armour. I know that I
  need to make these noises, but I'm just thinking out loud."* m55 left this written down as a
  stated gap -- *"what it hits is arguably the better key"* -- and he closed it from the other
  side, in the same words.
  **THE BLOCKER WAS A BOOLEAN.** `strikeSweep` returned 1, so the call site knew a swing had
  connected and had no idea WITH WHAT -- which is why m55 could only split the sound by WEAPON.
  It returns the first body caught now; `p.melFired` already gates the sound to one per strike
  however many `hitAll` goes on to reach, and **every caller tests it for truth and nothing
  compares it to 1**, so returning the man cost nothing and broke nothing.
  **TWO TABLES, TWO FACTS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SHAPE.** `K.snd` on the KIND says what a blow on
  that body sounds like; the weapon multiplies the weight on top of it -- heavier and lower for a
  hammer, lighter and higher for a fist -- so a hammer on a drunk and a fist on a drunk are the
  same sound at two weights, which is right. **A kind with no `snd` keeps `clang`**, so a body
  added tomorrow is never silent.
      warrior   clang   armoured, and the one body in here his sentence is about
      officer   soft    a man in a uniform, not an orc in plate. ARGUABLE -- `snd: 'clang'` is
                        the one word if a vest should ring, and it is stated rather than assumed
      hick      soft
      hobo      soft
  **`HITSND` CARRIES THE WHOLE SHAPE AND NOT JUST THE FILE**, because a stand-in that is the
  wrong file is almost always the wrong LENGTH and the wrong PITCH too. `box_break_01` at its own
  rate is unmistakably a crate; dropped to .55 and cut to 130 ms it is at least a dull impact.
  **AND THERE IS NOTHING ON DISK THAT IS A BODY BEING HIT.** All fourteen files are metal, air,
  electricity or explosions, which is exactly why he is going to record these. So `SFX.files.soft`
  is named, wired and **marked a stand-in**: drop a file at that path, `npm run bump`, and nothing
  else moves. Same pattern as `CLIPS.block` and the hick's empty pose names -- write it to take
  the asset the moment one exists.
  **ITS OWN KEY RATHER THAN SHARING `thud`'s**, so the player taking a blow and an NPC taking one
  cannot gate each other through `SFX.last`'s per-key `gap`, and either can be re-pointed alone.
  That is `splat`'s own argument at m55, one event over.
  **AND THE BOLT'S IMPACT IS ALREADY ON ITS OWN HOOK.** *"I like the electricity and the launch
  noise of the ball, but when it hits them it needs a more punchy noise. Just the explosion noise
  wasn't great."* m55 took it off `explosion_small.mp3` and onto `splat` -- the beam file cut to
  an instant -- so if he is still hearing an explosion he is on m54 or older. **The stand-in is
  deliberately NOT re-tuned here**: churning a sound he is about to replace is work that gets
  thrown away, and the one-line swap is already in place.
- **SMALLER AGAIN, AND THE COST IS ALL AT THE TOP OF THE STICK (m57, `RIG.height` 1.45 -> 1.25).**
  *"I wanna try making the character smaller again."* `SZ` and `GAIT.refScale` between them make
  this one edit, which is what m52 was for -- the collider, the camera, his step, his reach and
  his fist all follow, the world does not, and every locomotion reference re-scales at load:
      h 1.75   scale x1.926   sprintRef 4.55   sprint clip asks 1.58x   no slide
      h 1.45   scale x1.596   sprintRef 3.77             1.91x          16% at full deflection
      h 1.25   scale x1.376   sprintRef 3.25             2.22x          **28%**
      warrior 1.85 is now 48% taller than he is; the hick 42%, the hobo 39%
  **`scaleSpeed` IS 0, WHICH IS HIS OWN m53 DECISION AND IS WHAT COSTS THIS.** Keeping his world
  speed at a smaller size is exactly the *"quicker despite him technically moving at the same
  rate"* he asked for -- the stride covers more ground per step -- and the arithmetic of that is
  `MOVE.max / sprintRef`, which grows every time he shrinks. Every band BELOW the sprint is inside
  `tsHi` and simply reads faster; it is only the top of the stick that slides.
  **`mel.GAIT.tsHi` IS THE DIAL AND IT IS NOT FREE**: it applies to every clip, and m53 brought it
  to 1.6 because at 1.9 the walk clip is a cartoon scramble through the whole walk/run crossfade.
  **A faster sprint clip is still the honest fix** and is still a stated open item.
  `mel.RIG.height` is NOT live -- the scale is measured at load -- so it wants a reload.

- **A BLAST RADIUS USED AS A COLLISION RADIUS IS AN EIGHT-METRE CORRIDOR (m56).** *"The radius
  of the collider of the Warrior aliens versus the charged blaster shot -- when they're almost off
  screen to my left, I still hit them. You need a little bit more specificity."* Exactly that, and
  the arithmetic is flat:
      full charge   ball  1.90 m ACROSS, so a visible radius of 0.95
                    test  size*.5 + blast + warrior r  =  .95 + 2.60 + .46  =  **4.01 m**
      fumble        test  .225 + .55 + .46 = 1.24, against a ball 0.45 across
  **AND IT RAN EVERY HALF-STEP OF THE FLIGHT**, not at a landing -- so it was not a sphere at an
  impact, it was a **four-metre-radius cylinder swept down the whole sixty-metre shot**, and the
  first man within four metres of the path anywhere along it WAS the impact. His sentence describes
  the shape precisely: off to the left, never aimed at, still hit.
  **m36 WAS NOT WRONG; IT WAS ONE NUMBER DOING TWO JOBS.** *"If I shoot a ball and it hits in the
  general area of a few of them, that should hit more than one at a time."* That is a blast, and
  `blast0`/`blast1` were sized for it -- the field's own comment said **"how far from the impact a
  body is caught"** and there was no impact to measure from, because the blast radius was what
  decided where the impact happened. **A comment describing an intent the code cannot express is
  the tell.** So the two are separate now and each does its own job:
      in flight   `size * .5` -- the ball, which is what he can SEE. 1.41 m at a full charge with
                  his own radius, and 0.68 at a fumble. You have to land it.
      on death    `size * .5 + blast` at the point it lands -- unchanged, so a crowd still goes
                  over together and m36 survives whole.
  **NOBODY IS BLOWN TWICE AND THAT NEEDED NO CASE.** `dummyBlow` sets `d.cool` and `dummyHit`
  skips anyone on it, so the man the ball hit directly is already out by the time the blast pass
  runs. The direct hit runs first by construction, because it is what killed the bolt.
  **THE BLAST IS SPENT WHEREVER IT DIES**, including on a wall, on the ground and at `boltLife` --
  which is right: a near miss that hits the wall behind him still catches him, and that is the
  whole of what an area weapon is for.
  **AND THE TEST IS STILL PURELY HORIZONTAL, WHICH IS A STATED GAP.** `dummyHit` has no y term at
  all, and the bolt is aimed at `aimTarget()` -- a point on the ground or a wall -- so it DESCENDS
  across its flight from a muzzle at chest height. A shot aimed at open ground sixty metres out
  passes well over a man at thirty and still reads as horizontally on top of him. Same class of
  complaint, not fixed here, deliberately: this build moves 4.01 m to 1.41 and **each toggle has to
  move one variable** or neither can be judged.
  **NO COLLIDER VIEW EXISTS IN THIS REPO.** Shredworld has one (`BOXES`, badge tap 12) and it is
  what settled the identical fault there -- *"the bolt tested a CIRCLE on the car's long axis"*,
  c161 -- so it is worth building the first time a hit radius has to be argued about rather than
  computed.

- **A BLOW ON A BODY RINGS, AND IT WAS LITERALLY A BOX BREAKING (m55).** *"The sound effect
  for when he melees and hits the warriors is like a box break, and I want it to be more like
  the clang noise."* Exactly that: `SFX.files.thud` is `box_break_01.mp3`, a crate coming apart,
  and the FIST played it while only the hammer rang. **He was describing the file, not a
  resemblance.**
  **THE TWO ARE STILL TOLD APART, BY WEIGHT RATHER THAN BY FILE.** A hammer is heavier and lower
  (g .9, rate .80), a fist lighter and higher (g .62, rate 1.22) -- which is the metal clangs'
  own rule one repo over, where three car tiers are told apart by PITCH and not by three
  recordings.
  **WHAT IT HITS IS ARGUABLY THE BETTER KEY AND IT IS A STATED GAP** -- a warrior is armoured
  and a drunk is not -- but `strikeSweep` reports a CONNECT rather than a body, and `hitAll`
  means one swing can land on several at once. A `snd` field on the KIND table is where that
  goes, beside `dmg`.
  **`thud` IS NOW ONLY THE PLAYER TAKING A BLOW**, which is the one place a dull break is right.
- **A PLASMA BOLT LANDING IS NOT A DETONATION (m55, `SFX.files.splat`).** *"I don't love the
  noise when the plasma cannon hits them -- it's kind of an explosion noise, whereas I want it
  to be more of, I'm not sure, something else. I'll probably go make a better one."*
  `explosion_small.mp3` is exactly what it says on the tin, and it is the wrong VOCABULARY
  rather than the wrong mix: what arrives is a ball of charged gas. The nearest thing on disk is
  the electrical beam, **cut to the length of an impact**.
  **AND THE LENGTH IS THE WHOLE TRICK, WHICH IS WHY `dur` IS HERE.** That file is a BEAM --
  seconds of it -- and an impact is an instant. m26 paid for exactly this once, when the arming
  zap *"kept playing for the full gambit of the noise"*, and `dur`'s ramp is what stops a
  mid-waveform cut being a click. A bigger hit rings a little longer; the rate goes DOWN and the
  gain UP with the charge, the way every other charged thing in this file reads heavier.
  **IT IS A STAND-IN AND IT IS MARKED AS ONE.** He is going to record it: drop the file in,
  point `SFX.files.splat` at it, nothing else moves. `boom` stays loaded and unused so
  `mel.snd('boom')` is still the A/B.
  **IT IS ITS OWN KEY RATHER THAN SHARING `zap`**, so the two cannot gate each other through
  `SFX.last`'s per-key `gap` and either can be re-pointed without touching the other. The bytes
  come off the HTTP cache the second time; only the decode is paid twice, on a short file.
- **WHERE HE ENDS UP IS WHERE HE IS (m54).** *"When I press up on the right stick to send him
  about the camera it works, it's good. But then when you release, he goes back to his original
  position, which is not ideal -- that should just be his new position."* Exactly what it did,
  and it is one line: **`p.heading` is only ever written from the THUMB**, and the `!aiming`
  gate freezes it for the whole hold -- so on release `faceTgt` fell back to whatever he was
  facing before the hold began and he eased all the way round again.
  **IT FOLLOWS `faceH` WHILE AIMING RATHER THAN BEING ADOPTED ON AN EDGE.** An edge is a thing
  to remember in three places -- the trigger, the guard and the square-up all freeze it the same
  way -- and a thing to get wrong once. Following it means there is nothing to hand over,
  because on the release frame `faceTgt` is already `faceH` and he simply stops.
  **RELEASED MID-TURN HE HOLDS WHERE HE GOT TO**, which is the predictable answer: carrying on
  to finish a turn nobody is asking for any more is the same surprise pointed the other way.
  **AND IT COSTS NOTHING WHILE THE LEFT STICK IS HELD**, because `heading` is rewritten from the
  thumb the moment `aiming` ends. It only ever shows standing still -- which is exactly when he
  is turning to look at something. **`p.heading` has precisely one reader (`faceTgt`)**, checked
  rather than assumed, which is what makes following it safe.
- **HE HAS NO TURN CLIPS, AND THE HOOK IS WIRED (m54, `CLIPS.turnL`/`turnR`, `GAIT.turn*`).**
  *"I do need to add some animations for when he turns, if we don't already have turn left /
  turn right, because he just rotates, not moving his feet at all -- and that would be the time
  to use those."* **Read straight out of the file: 24 clips and not a turn among them.** The
  WARRIOR has four (`standing_turn_*`), which is probably where the memory comes from, and they
  are on a different rig. So this is wired and waiting rather than guessed at, `CLIPS.block`'s
  own pattern: name one and it blends, leave it empty and `turnWeight` is zero and nothing in
  the gait changes.
  **IT IS DRIVEN BY THE BODY'S TURN RATE, NOT BY THE ANGLE STILL TO GO.** The residual says how
  far he has LEFT, which is large the instant a turn starts and large again if he is standing
  still facing the wrong way; the rate says whether he is actually moving. Damped, because one
  frame of jitter must not flicker a clip in and out. **+X IS HIS LEFT**, so a positive rate
  picks `turnL`.
  **AND IT TAKES WEIGHT RATHER THAN ADDING IT.** The gait below is a four-clip CHAIN that sums
  to exactly 1 by construction, and a table over or under 1 bleeds the BIND pose in -- the
  T-pose exactly. So the turn is paid for out of `rest`, the same budget the landing already
  comes out of, and every branch downstream keeps summing to what it was handed.
  **IT SITS ABOVE THE BRANCHES**, because turning on the spot happens in the ordinary gait AND
  in the committed one -- squaring up to the camera and pivoting is the case he reported it
  from -- so computing it once is what stops it being two copies.
  **AND IT IS GONE BY A WALK** (`turnUpTo` 1.1): once the gait is already showing his feet move,
  a turn clip on top of it is two strides at once. Measured through the curve: standing and
  turning deliberately it reaches .90, at half a metre a second .51, at a walk and above zero.
  **THE RATE SCALING WANTS MEASURING WHEN THEY LAND** -- `npm run gait`'s planted-foot method
  reads a walk, and the equivalent for a turn is degrees per second of the HIPS. Until then they
  play at 1.0x, which is what a turn clip is usually authored at.
- **I MADE THE SPEED PROPORTIONAL AND THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF THE ASK (m53,
  `GAIT.scaleSpeed`).** *"I thought making him smaller would make the locomotion seem a little
  quicker despite him technically moving at the same rate -- because he has these big giant
  chunky feet, and when he runs his stride is just so funny. He's moving these giant big feet
  but they're not going that far. Did you keep his stride and speed proportional to his new
  smaller size, or did you keep it the same?"*
  **I SCALED IT, AND PROPORTIONAL IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM.** m52 moved
  `MOVE.max` and the bands along with the refs, which preserves the stride PERFECTLY relative to
  his body -- so he covers 17% fewer metres and from the camera the locomotion is the identical
  picture, only smaller. The whole complaint is that the stride is short for the feet, and the
  proportional answer keeps that intact by construction. **My reason was the "feet never slide
  at the top" invariant**, which is a real invariant and was the wrong thing to protect here.
      scaleSpeed 1   proportional. Same picture, smaller. Nothing slides.
      scaleSpeed 0   he keeps his world speed at four fifths the size, so every locomotion clip
                     plays **1.21x faster** for the same metres -- the stride covers more ground
                     per step, which is the "quicker" he described. **Default.**
  **THE REFS ALWAYS SCALE EITHER WAY.** That half is a FACT about the model scale, not a choice,
  and it is what m52 got right.
  **AND THE BANDS GO WITH `MOVE.max`, NEVER APART FROM IT.** Where a band lands on the PAD is
  `band / MOVE.max`, so moving one without the other is the m27 finding undone -- and moving
  both together leaves every crossfade where it was under either setting.
  **THE COST IS AT THE VERY TOP AND NOWHERE ELSE.** `MOVE.max` 7.2 against a scaled `sprintRef`
  of 3.77 asks the sprint clip for **1.91x against a `tsHi` of 1.6**, so it clamps and the feet
  slide about 16% at full deflection. Every band below is inside the cap and simply reads
  faster. `mel.GAIT.tsHi` is the dial and **a faster sprint clip is the honest fix** -- already
  a stated open item.
  **AND THE LESSON IS THE ANSWER TO "DID YOU".** He had to ask, which means the build note said
  what I did and not what it would FEEL like. A change with two defensible readings needs the
  reading stated in the reply, not only the mechanism.
- **THE MODE BUTTONS ARE ANNULAR SECTORS ROUND THE RIGHT STICK (m53, `MODES`).** *"Take two
  rings, one smaller, one larger, and cut pizza slices out of that -- those buttons would be
  like those segments."* The pad is a circle, so the controls that belong to it share its
  CENTRE: that is what makes them read as part of the same object rather than as a HUD element
  that happens to sit nearby, and it is the same argument the kit ring is built on one repo over.
  **THE SVG IS HUNG OFF THE PAD'S OWN INSET PLUS ITS RADIUS**, never written a second time, so
  the annulus cannot drift off the pad on a notched phone. It deliberately OVERHANGS the screen
  edge and that costs nothing, because `pointer-events: none` on the root means only the paths
  are targets.
  **`pointer-events: all` IS WHAT GIVES AN UNFILLED PATH A HIT AREA.** The alternative is a
  translucent fill, and m50's whole finding is that nothing on these pads should be a tint.
  **SCREEN Y POINTS DOWN, so a maths angle maps with its sine NEGATED** -- get that wrong and
  the set mirrors BELOW the pad, which is the one place it must not be. Checked as rectangles on
  a 390 x 844 phone: both sectors land at x 202-349, y 646-733, entirely on screen, clear of the
  left pad, and by construction outside the pad's circle (their inner ring is r0 74 against its
  radius 69).
  **AND ALL OF IT IS DERIVED FROM `MODES` AND `WEAP.modes`**: a third mode is a row in that
  table and the arc simply divides three ways. `mid` is 115 degrees rather than straight up,
  because straight up puts the outer segment off the right edge of a phone.
  **THE LABEL IS HORIZONTAL, NOT SET ON THE ARC.** At a 32 px band and ten-pixel type, text bent
  round a curve is decoration bought with legibility -- and legibility is the entire job of a
  control whose only purpose is to say which of two states you are in.
- **HE IS A LITTLE GUY AND HE WAS NOT DRAWN LIKE ONE (m52, `RIG.height` 1.75 -> 1.45, `SZ`).**
  *"He's kind of big compared to the guys that are supposed to be big bad warrior alien orcs --
  he's almost bigger than them even though his character is a little guy. I'm wondering if
  making him smaller would make the movements feel more grand."* Measured rather than eyeballed:
  hero **1.75**, warrior **1.85**. Six per cent is not a size difference, it is a rounding
  error. At 1.45 the warrior is **28% taller** and the hick and the hobo are a head over him.
  **A NUMBER HERE IS EITHER A PROPERTY OF HIS BODY OR A PROPERTY OF THE WORLD**, and shrinking
  him must move only the first kind. `SZ` is the ratio to `RIG.base`, so one edit moves the
  whole set and there is nothing to remember:
      SCALES    the collider (`r`, `hh`), `CAM.look`, `MOVE.step` (his LEG -- half a metre is
                his own hip at this size), `MELEE.arrive` (arm's length), `STRIKE.r` (his fist)
      DOES NOT  `CAM.dist`, `MOVE.jump`, `g`, the boxes, the building, the other bodies
  **AND `SZ` HAS TO BE DECLARED ABOVE EVERY TABLE THAT READS IT.** It went in beside `GAIT` and
  `MOVE` is declared FIRST, so `step: .5 * SZ` was a temporal dead zone -- **a blank page, and
  `npm run check:boot` caught it on the first run.** Eighth time across these repos, and the one
  the gate exists for. It sits immediately after `RIG` now.
- **AND A CLIP'S REFERENCE SPEED IS A FACT ABOUT THE MODEL SCALE (m52, `GAIT.refScale`).** This
  is the half that makes a height edit survivable at all. A reference is how fast the PLANTED
  FOOT slides backwards, which is authored travel TIMES the scale the model is drawn at -- so
  every number in `GAIT` was only ever true at **x1.926**, and a smaller hero whose refs did not
  follow plays every locomotion clip about **21% too slow** for the speed he is moving at. Not a
  slide at the top of the range: a slide at every point of it.
  They are scaled ONCE at load off `rig.scale`, not off `RIG.height` -- a re-export at a
  different authored height moves the scale without moving `RIG.height`, and the refs have to
  follow the one that actually changed. `mel.GAIT` therefore prints the SCALED numbers, which is
  the honest thing for it to print.
  **AND `MOVE.max` AND THE BANDS GO WITH THEM, WHICH IS THE PART THAT IS EASY TO MISS.**
  `MOVE.max` **IS** the sprint clip's own speed -- that is what makes the fastest clip play at
  1.0x at full deflection and the feet never slide at the top. Scaling the refs ALONE leaves it
  21% above the sprint it is meant to be: measured, the clip is then asked for **1.91x against
  a `tsHi` of 1.6**, so it clamps and he slides for the whole top of the stick. And the BANDS
  are speeds too, so leaving those would move every crossfade to a different place on the pad
  -- **which is exactly the m27 finding, undone by a height edit.** One factor over the whole
  table keeps every relationship: verified, all four bands land on the **identical percentage of
  the pad** (0.241 / 0.379 / 0.545 / 0.759) and the sprint clip plays at **1.58x, unchanged**.
  **AND "GRAND" IS THE WORLD, NOT HIS PACE.** Nothing else shrank, so he is four fifths the size
  against every box, the building and every other body, and the camera sits lower. `mel.MOVE.max`
  is the dial if he should also be FAST for his size; the cost of raising it is foot slide, and
  `tsHi` caps how much.
- **THE RAPID FIRE STOPPED BEING A SLOT AND BECAME A MODE WITH A BUTTON (m52, `WEAP.modes`,
  `modeNow`, `autoNow`, `#modeRow`).** *"When your blaster is equipped you have a button -- for
  now, until I build different guns that do different stuff, we'll just have this one do two
  modes. Above the right stick two buttons pop up and you click one for the sort of ball charge
  and the other one is the automatic, where you just press and hold up and that does rapid
  fire."*
  **m36 MADE IT A SLOT ON AN ARGUMENT THAT IS NOW ANSWERED BETTER.** *"A hidden mode is a state
  you can be in without knowing it"* -- right, and the fix for a hidden mode is to SHOW it, not
  to spend a kit slot on it. The two buttons ARE the state: on screen, lit, and only while the
  gun that has them is out. Same trade the guard made at m37. It also takes the kit cycle from
  four taps to three, and the two slots were identical to look at anyway because they share the
  model.
  **THE ROW IS BUILT FROM `WEAP.modes`**, so a third mode is a row in that table and nothing in
  the DOM -- and giving one its own `file:` is what would make it a different GUN rather than a
  different trigger.
  **AND IT EXISTS ONLY WHERE IT MEANS SOMETHING.** A mode row for a weapon with no modes is a
  HUD element sitting in the play area saying nothing, which is the `actB` lesson one game over.
  It is positioned off the right pad's OWN insets, so the two cannot drift apart on a notched
  phone the way two independently written positions eventually would.
  **`pointerdown`, NOT `click`**, and both `preventDefault` and `stopPropagation`: a click is
  synthesised after the touch has ended, and the one thing that must never happen on this row is
  a tap that also reaches the pad behind it.
  **AND SWITCHING MID-HOLD STANDS THE TRIGGER DOWN**, because a wound-up charge handed to a
  weapon that does not bank one has nowhere to go. `setMode` is the one place, so the lit button,
  the hint and what the trigger actually does cannot disagree.
  **The name stays the slot's**: "BLASTER - CHARGE" in the display face is wide enough to meet
  the build chip on a 390 px phone, and the mode is already on screen as a lit button.
- **THE CHARGE SETS THE REACH; THE TARGET SETS THE DISTANCE (m51, `MELEE.dashFree = 0`,
  `chargeAim`, `MELEE.dashLand`).** *"The way I think it will work is you still always launch to
  the character's position... the distance he travels always ends right at them, so that the full
  animation and swing finishes right at them -- you'll have to basically gauge the distance.
  There should still be a distance cap, in that the longer you charge the farther you can
  actually launch to hit them. It's just, regardless, when you release he still always launches
  to them within reason, within a cap."*
  **BOTH OF THE PREVIOUS SHAPES WERE ONE HALF OF THAT, AND THE LINE IS THE SAME LINE:**
      m21   `far = gap`               the man sets it, and the hold buys NOTHING
      m43   `far = wantD`             the hold sets it, and he goes straight THROUGH him
      m51   `far = min(gap, wantD)`   the hold is the CAP, the man is the DISTANCE
  **m43'S FINDING STANDS AND WAS NEVER ABOUT THE `min`.** What made the hold meaningless was
  that `finishRange` 26 acquired a man in a 24-degree cone from across the street, so `gap` was
  always the small number and `wantD` had no way to matter. `chargeAim`'s `acq` is what makes
  the cap real: **a target is only taken if the charge can actually carry him to it**, which is
  m20's rule -- an assist's range is sized for what it DELIVERS, not for what it draws --
  arriving on the melee side three builds late. A man past the reach is not acquired, so the
  dash covers the whole hold and falls short of him, which is what "gauge the distance" means.
- **AND HE WAS STILL MOVING WHEN THE HAMMER LANDED (m51, `MELEE.dashLand`).** *"He launches
  through them and so they go flying before he's even swung his hammer."* That is a SECOND
  cause and clamping the travel does not fix it: `carry` bleeds him to zero across the WHOLE
  state, so at the contact frame (`finishAt` .38) he has covered **.38 / .725 = 52% of the
  distance** and spends the other 48% ploughing on past the man he has just hit.
  **THE TRAVEL IS SPENT BY `dashLand` .42 AND HE IS STATIONARY FROM THERE**, so the blow is the
  hammer arriving at a body that has already arrived, and the rest of the clip is the
  follow-through it was drawn as. One `uu = u / arr` in the bleed, `arr` 1 for every other move,
  so the line is unchanged for everything that is not a dash.
  **AND `STRIKE.dashFrom` GOES BACK TO `from`.** m45's 0 was the right fix for the wrong shape:
  the dash used to plough past anybody close, so opening the window on frame one was the only
  way to catch them -- and catching them ON THE WAY THROUGH is precisely what he then described.
  **AND `dashV` HAD TO RISE WITH IT**, 66 -> 76: the clock is now `goDur * carryAvg * dashLand`
  = **.158 s**, not .377, so at 66 the furthest reachable became 10.45 m against a `flatFar` cap
  of 11 -- a lock the dash cannot deliver, which is the very thing `acq` was added to stop.
  Measured through the solve: every target case stops **exactly `arrive` 1.05 m short of him**,
  a full hold with nobody in range still covers 11.00 m, and a half hold 8.38.
- **A MARK ON THE FLOOR IS NOT A LOCK (m51, `MARK`, `markStep`).** *"Maybe we'll put a little
  circle under their feet, that kind of shows that they're qualifying as what your target is --
  rather than the lock, where the aimer is on them."* He has now turned down two assists that
  MOVED HIS AIM and kept the one that only moves his BODY, and this is the same distinction
  drawn in the art: **a mark drawn ON a man is a lock** -- your eye goes to it and you stop
  aiming -- **and a mark on the FLOOR under him is a fact about the world**, where the dash is
  about to put you, readable without looking away from the fight.
  **IT PULSES AND THEN SNAPS.** The ring TIGHTENS as the hold fills, which is the reticle's own
  argument (how loaded something is should be a SHAPE, not a bar), and at full it goes hot and
  stops breathing -- a DIFFERENT mark rather than a brighter one, which is the only kind
  readable at a glance instead of by comparison with a memory.
  **AND `chargeAim` IS ONE FUNCTION BECAUSE THE MARK IS A PROMISE.** `markStep` calls it every
  frame to draw the ring and `chargeRelease` calls it on the frame the thumb lifts to aim the
  dash. Two places computing "who is the target" is exactly the m20 bug -- the mark on one man
  and the shot at another -- and the fix there was to make it one call. **The circle can never
  appear under somebody the dash will fall short of**, by construction.
  **The chip reads `charge0.7>4.2`**: how wound, and how far off the man it has. No `>` at all
  means the release will cover the whole hold instead. "It didn't go to him" and "it never had
  him" are opposite bugs and one picture from a phone.
- **THE HAMMER SAYS IT IS LOADED, AND FULL IS AN EVENT (m51, `HCHG`).** *"We need to make it
  really obvious when the hammer is charging. I'm not sure how to do this, but maybe the hammer
  starts to glow and pulse, maybe his stance gets more violent, maybe it smokes -- something to
  know when you're fully charged. We could put a little bar."*
  **A BAR IS A NUMBER YOU LOOK AWAY TO READ.** Sparks off the head are something you see while
  still watching the fight, and they cost nothing: `spk` is a pool and one draw call, and
  `muzzleWorld()` is the measured far end of the geometry along the mount's own axis -- which on
  a hammer IS the head, so nothing about where they come from is typed.
  **THE RATE TIGHTENS AS IT FILLS** (`every0` -> `every1`), which is the jetpack's own lesson one
  weapon over: a single puff is a sticker and a run of them coming faster is a machine winding
  up. **AND THE TOP-OUT IS THREE THINGS ON ONE FRAME** -- a ring thrown off the head, a clang,
  and the ring under the target going hot -- fired on the CROSSING (`was < charge && now >=`)
  rather than on "it is full", which would fire every frame it is held.
  **AND THE GLOW HOOK WAS GATED ON THE WRONG QUESTION.** `if (slot.aim)` is "does this weapon
  shoot"; what `hueGlow` actually answers is "does it light up as the hold fills", which the
  hammer now does too. `GUNU` stays ONE shared uniform set -- only one weapon is ever mounted
  and `mountWeapon` re-measures the hue per slot -- but the two weapons were then both damping
  it every frame toward different targets, which is **two writers on one number**, so the slot
  names the source and there is exactly one line that moves it.
- **THE MELEE LUNGE SOLVED FOR THE GAP AND THEN THREW THE ANSWER AWAY (m51).** *"When you're
  swiping generally towards them it more or less moves directly to them, or to right in front of
  them, so that his melee animation really actually nails them perfectly."* It did solve for
  `dist - arrive` -- and then clamped the result UP to `base`, a typed lunge speed that has
  nothing to do with where the man is:
      man 1.5 m off   solves to 1.0 m/s   floored at 7.0   covers 3.1 m   = **1.6 m PAST him**
  every single time, which is the whole of "he goes through them". `base` is the FREE lunge, for
  a flick at nobody; a solved one is solved and the only floor it needs is **zero**. A man
  already at arm's length now gets a swing thrown on the spot.
  **AND THE CONE WIDENED, .42 -> .60** (24 deg -> 34). *"You can kind of button-smash with the
  stick -- swipe, swipe, swipe -- and he hits him, goes back, goes across to them. It's because
  of the aim assist on the melee, so he always kind of targets them if you're at least flicking
  in their general direction, and for a mobile game that's pretty good because you're pretty
  limited."* **"General direction" is a wider cone than "aimed at"**, and this one is safe to
  widen where the blaster's was not: it only ever pulls a LUNGE -- a physical assist with
  nothing drawn and nothing taken off the thumb, the half he has now asked to keep three times
  -- and the strike's own reach caps how far it can drag him.
- **A DEAD ZONE IS THE SLACK AT CENTRE, NOT A REGION (m51, `CAM.deadAim` .20 -> .12).** *"I
  really just wanted it to be like a subtle grace right in the middle."* Which is the right way
  to say what the number is FOR -- and because it SUBTRACTS rather than gates, a wide one is not
  merely a wide middle: the rescale goes on costing sensitivity all the way out to full lock, so
  it makes the stick heavy everywhere. Third pass on this number, and the lesson is that .34 and
  .20 were both sized against the RANGE rather than against the wobble.
- **NOT DONE, AND DELIBERATELY: the strike-pose clips and the multi-target combo.** *"I do need
  to put in better animations... I wanna play with the super fast ending in strike position pose
  things, which actually sounds fairly easy because it's less animation."* He is right that it is
  less animation and it is also a different SHAPE of move -- the travel comes first and the pose
  is HELD at the end, which is `MELEE.carry` inverted. `dashLand` is now exactly that shape for
  the charge: the travel is spent in the first 42% and the rest of the clip is the pose. Wire the
  ordinary strikes the same way when the clips land; do not fake it by retuning `carry`.
  And *"maybe if there's two guys or three you do a little combo and quickly hit all of them --
  not yet"*: `hitAll` already means the swept weapon catches everyone in the arc, so what that
  would need is a CHAIN of dashes rather than a wider blow.
- **THE INK WAS PAYING TWICE FOR WHAT THE COLOUR HAD ALREADY BOUGHT (m50).** *"You gave the
  sticks a slight drop shadow, I think we should remove that -- and the slight dim. I think the
  colours are enough. It makes it hard to read the little writing."* m49's rule was right about
  the problem and wrong about the remedy: what a white ring lacked was **CHROMA**, not WEIGHT.
  A saturated hue on a white floor is already high contrast, so the dark fill, the outer glow,
  the knob's drop shadow and the label's halo were a second solution to a solved problem -- and
  each one cost something: the fill greys the floor under the thumb, and **a dark halo behind
  ten-pixel text at .12em of tracking fills the counters and muddies the letters it was meant
  to lift.** The rim went 2px to 3px so the shape carries on one crisp line, the knob is a solid
  disc with one dark edge, and nothing on either pad is translucent, blurred or tinted.
  **THE `.act` FEEDBACK MOVED FROM THE FILL TO THE RIM** for the same reason: a tint that says
  "you are touching this" is a tint over the play area the rest of the time.
- **A DEAD ZONE IS SIZED TO THE WOBBLE, NOT TO THE RANGE (m50, `CAM.deadAim` .34 -> .20).**
  *"The dead zone now is like too strong, it's kinda hard to aim left and right."* A third of
  the pad spent on nothing is not a dead zone, it is a deliberate lean that does nothing.
  **AND m48'S OWN TABLE SAID SO -- I READ IT AS A PASS.** It reported **0.0 deg/s at 32% off
  centre** and I wrote that up as the fix working, when 32% of a pad is plainly a turn being
  asked for. The number to size against is the residual x a HELD thumb carries (.1 to .3), so
  .20 kills the bottom of that band and leaves the top of it turning. **A measurement that
  reports zero everywhere is as suspicious as one that reports zero nowhere** -- ask which of
  the rows were meant to be non-zero before calling it green.
- **HOLD UP BARE-HANDED AND HE SQUARES UP TO THE CAMERA (m50, `p.center`).** *"When you're
  disarmed, if you press up on the right stick he should centre to the view -- so now if you
  hold down on the left stick he runs backwards, if you hold left he strafes to the side, until
  you release the right stick."*
  **IT COST ALMOST NOTHING BECAUSE IT IS THE `aiming` BRANCH WITH EMPTY HANDS.** That branch
  already means exactly what he described: face where the lens looks, let `plant` go to zero so
  the legs carry him wherever the thumb says instead of dragging his body round to point that
  way, and let `rigAnim` pick the back/strafe clip off the SIGN of his travel. The guard
  borrowed it at m39 with the same `bare` handling; this is a THIRD caller, not a second copy.
  **UP WAS THE FREE GESTURE AND ONLY ON THIS SLOT.** It is the trigger with a gun and the
  wind-up with the hammer, and unarmed it did nothing at all -- so it is gated on the SLOT
  (`!s.aim && !s.charge`) rather than on a mode, and there is nothing to be in without knowing
  it. Same four gates through `padUp`: a third answer to "is the thumb pushed up" is a third
  thing to keep in step with the other two.
  **AND THE RING LIGHTS.** There is no weapon and no charge to show, so without it the only
  thing saying the hold took is the character turning -- which is also what he looks like when
  the camera happens to swing. The chip says `SQUARE`.
- **NOBODY GETS UP ON THE SAME FRAME (m50, `d.lie`, `d.upB`).** *"If I shoot them all three down
  at the same time they all get up at the exact same time -- we should stagger it by a different
  small amount so it feels more random."* `K.out` and `K.upBeat` were CONSTANTS, so three men
  knocked down together stood up in step, for ever, which reads as one animation played three
  times rather than as three men.
  **TWO NUMBERS, BECAUSE HE ASKED FOR THE RATE AS WELL**: how long he lies there and how long
  the get-up takes are different things. **ROLLED AT THE KNOCK-DOWN, NOT AT SPAWN**, so the same
  three do not stagger in the same order every fight.
  **AND THE STATE'S LENGTH HAS TO READ THE SAME `d.upB` THE CLIP WAS SCALED BY**, or it cuts the
  get-up off part-way -- the m8 landmine, which is exactly what a per-body beat would walk into.
- **THREE MEN MARCHING AT ONE SPEED DOWN ONE LINE IS ONE MAN DRAWN THREE TIMES (m50, `foeGait`,
  `foeLane`).** *"They just all kind of walk at the exact same speed towards me... maybe they
  don't always go in a straight line towards you, a little more intelligent path as well as
  speed. Sometimes it's a little faster, sometimes they stop, sometimes they turn, sometimes a
  little bit slower."*
  **m36 ALREADY ROLLED A `pace` PER BODY AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH, WHICH IS THE POINT.** A CONSTANT
  multiplier spreads three men along one line and every one of them still moves at ONE speed, in
  a STRAIGHT line, for ever. **What reads as a person is the speed CHANGING and the line
  BENDING**, so what varies has to vary over TIME and not once at spawn. Three things off one
  clock, one per word of his sentence:
      lane    a bearing he drifts off dead-on   -- "not a straight line", "sometimes they turn"
      surge   a multiplier on his own pace      -- "a little faster... a little slower"
      hold    a hesitation instead of a lane    -- "sometimes they stop"
  **HE AIMS OFF AND WALKS WHERE HE IS POINTED.** `foeMove` drives him along `d.h`, which
  `faceTo` eases toward whatever it is given -- so biasing the FACE target bends the path for
  free, with an ease already on it, and there is no second bearing for the body and the travel
  to disagree about. The ease is also what turns a re-rolled lane into a visible TURN rather
  than a jump sideways. It reaches the travel only in the APPROACH, because giving ground and
  circling both compute their own bearing.
  **AND THE LANE TAPERS TO NOTHING AS HE ARRIVES.** Sidling in from thirty degrees off is a man
  closing on you; doing it at arm's length is a man who cannot find you.
  **EACH BODY HAS HIS OWN CLOCK AND HIS OWN PHASE**, so three can never re-sync -- the smoke
  plumes' rule. **AND A RE-ROLL IS A LANE *OR* A HESITATION, NEVER BOTH**, or a man stops and
  changes direction on the same frame, which reads as a glitch rather than as a decision.
  **`V.dash` IS THE HALF THAT WAS MOST VISIBLY SHARED.** A flat `notice * .45` meant every one
  of them broke into a run at the identical distance and dropped out of it at the identical
  distance -- so the one moment that could have told them apart was the one moment they all
  agreed on. Rolled per body, one jogs nearly the whole way in and another is walking from
  twenty metres out.
  **THE DRUNKS GET THE SAME FUNCTION WITH NO LANE.** Their path is already their own (the roam
  ring gives every body a different point to walk to), so a lane would only be a man failing to
  arrive somewhere nobody can see; what the amble was missing is the speed changing and the
  occasional stop, which is the other two thirds of it. They breathe harder and stop more,
  because that is what a drunk amble IS -- and it is one line on the table.
  **AND THE RUN CLIP IS STILL SLOW**: `K.run` 2.6 against a `runRef` of 1.79 is what `standing_
  run_forward` is actually walking at, so more of them running does not make them faster. The
  honest fix for a slow clip is a faster clip, and it stays a stated open item.
- **A WHITE CONTROL ON A WHITE FLOOR IS NOT A FAINT CONTROL, IT IS NO CONTROL (m49).** *"We need
  to make the joysticks different colors, they're almost impossible to see on the white... I keep
  missing."* Every value on both pads was `#ffffff` at 5 to 30 per cent -- a treatment that only
  exists against a dark background, and the world here is a white floor.
  **THE RULE IS THE DRAWN EFFECT WORDS' OWN, ONE REPO OVER: a FAT DARK RIM UNDER A SATURATED
  FILL survives ANY background**, because the ink carries the SHAPE and the colour carries the
  IDENTITY, while a translucent tint survives only the background it was picked against. Every
  ring is sandwiched now -- `#0b0d12` outside, the hue, `#0b0d12` inside -- and the knob is
  SOLID rather than a wash.
  **AND THE TWO HUES ARE NOT DECORATION.** They are two different controls -- the body and the
  verb -- and on a phone a thumb that lands on the wrong one has nothing to tell it so. `--pc`
  is the ONLY thing that differs between `#padL` (rose) and `#padR` (azure): the rim, the
  ticks, the knob and the label all read it, so a pad cannot end up half recoloured, and
  `mel.pads({ left, right })` moves both live.
  **THE ARM RING STAYS AMBER, which is now load-bearing rather than incidental** -- it has to be
  a different hue from whatever `--pc` is, or "the trigger is armed" degrades to "slightly
  brighter", which is the comparison-against-a-memory the reticle's own lock note refuses.
  **THE STYLING IS EIGHT STATIC TICKS AND THAT IS ALL.** *"Kind of similar to how we did the
  radical, but not as complex."* The reticle is five spinning layers because it is a MARK you
  READ; a pad is a place you PUT A THUMB, and anything moving under a thumb is something to look
  at instead of the game. One `repeating-conic-gradient` masked to an annulus on `::before`: no
  extra element, no animation, nothing written per frame.
  **THE TOUCH GEOMETRY IS UNTOUCHED.** `* { box-sizing: border-box }` and the border was already
  2px, so the rect `bindStick` measures is the same 132 px it always was; the `box-shadow` rim
  paints outside the element and is not in the hit area.
  **WHAT IS STILL NOT DONE IS THE FLOATING PAD** -- *"since we don't have the whole adjusting
  joystick thing on, which maybe we should think about in the future"*. A pad that appears where
  the thumb lands is the real fix for missing one; making it visible is the cheap half.
- **A THUMB PUSHED UP IS NEVER VERTICAL, AND THE AIM IS THE CAMERA (m48, `CAM.deadAim`).**
  *"When I'm trying to shoot and I'm aiming, I'm holding up on the right stick, and it's slightly
  sensitive -- the aimer goes right a little, goes left a little. I'd like it to just stay still,
  and left and right you'd have to go a little wider to turn the camera."* A held thumb carries
  an x of .1 to .3 the whole time, and at `yawRate` 2.6 that is up to **45 degrees a second** of
  turn under a thumb asking for none. **One writer on `cam.az` means that drift IS the reticle
  wandering** — the invariant that keeps the mark and the shot one answer is also what hands the
  camera's sensitivity straight to the aim.
  **AND IT IS A RESCALE, NOT A GATE.** `if (|rx| > .06) cam.az -= rx * rate` passes the FULL `rx`
  through the moment it clears, which is a step at the threshold: nothing, nothing, then .06 of
  rate all at once. Taking the dead zone OFF and stretching what is left back to 1 is continuous,
  gentler in the middle — the other half of "slightly sensitive" — and leaves full deflection at
  exactly the rate it always had. **A dead zone that subtracts is a dead zone; one that only
  gates is a threshold with a jump on it.** Measured: 149.0 deg/s at full lock, unchanged.
  **AND IT IS THE THUMB'S GEOMETRY, NOT `p.aim`.** Gating on the armed state leaves the `armT`
  window before the trigger latches running on the narrow zone — measured, **a one-off kick of
  2.5 to 3.4 degrees at the moment the aim starts**, which is the "it jumps a little" half. So it
  reads `padUp`, which is true from the first frame the thumb is up there, and whose hysteresis
  argument keeps it true once something IS armed: a thumb rolling inward mid-aim does not get the
  twitchy zone back.
  Measured over a two-second hold at 12 / 25 / 32 per cent off centre: **0.0 degrees**, against
  19 / 60 / 82 before. A deliberate lean still swings 92 deg/s, so turning while aiming is
  wider rather than gone.
- **THE WIND-UP HAD NO DIRECTION TEST AT ALL (m46, `padUp`).** *"The melee charge should only
  initiate when you hold up on the right pad, not any direction."* The gate was
  `R.down && PADS.R.hold() > MOVE.tapT` — **a third of a second of the thumb being anywhere on
  the pad** — so a CAMERA DRAG wound the hammer up and letting go swung it, which on this pad is
  the single most common thing a thumb does.
  **IT IS THE TRIGGER'S OWN FOUR GATES, SHARED RATHER THAN RE-DERIVED.** `padUp(on)` is now the
  one answer to "is the thumb pushed up" and both the blaster and the hammer call it: `arc` is
  what keeps a sideways drag a drag, `fireAt` is a push a nudge cannot reach, and `keepAt` is the
  hysteresis — it takes `fireAt` to arm and only `keepAt` to keep, so a thumb rolling inward as
  it lifts cannot cancel the swing you meant. **Two copies of that is two places for the trigger
  and the wind-up to start disagreeing about what a push up is**, which is what m37 said when the
  guard went on the same pad pointing the other way.
  **AND `tapT` IS GONE FROM IT**, which was the old gate's entire substance. It is redundant for
  the trigger's own reason: a push past `fireAt` .78 is already far beyond the tap's `far < .42`,
  so the jump and the wind-up cannot collide — and the wind-up can now be entered as fast as the
  thumb moves rather than a third of a second later.
  **THE POSE WAITS `armT` AND THE CHARGE DOES NOT.** A hold must not be shortened by its own
  gate, so `chargeT` starts at once; but a stab at the top that comes straight back is not a
  wind-up, and without the wait it swooshes and plays the strain every time. A stab could never
  SWING anyway (`chargeRelease` wants half a charge), so the delay is only on the sound and the
  clip — the two things a stab would make a liar of.
  **THE CASE FOR IT IS MOSTLY NEGATIVE ROWS**, because what was broken is something that must not
  happen: left, right, down and a diagonal all read `wound 0.00 s, chargeGo false`, straight up
  winds fully and swings, and a thumb rolled back to between `keepAt` and `fireAt` keeps its
  charge and still swings on the lift.
- **A MAN THREE METRES AHEAD WAS PASSED THROUGH AND TOOK NOTHING (m45, `STRIKE.dashFrom`).**
  *"Now the charge melee is working and now it's wayyyy too far. However I want the charge hit to
  send them flyingggfff and they don't really."* Two things, and the second one is a bug that
  m43 uncovered rather than caused.
  **THE WINDOW OPENED TOO LATE FOR A MOVE THIS FAST.** `STRIKE.from` .55 is a fraction of the
  clip's authored CONTACT FRAME, which is right for a standing swing — the arm has to get moving
  before it can hit anything. It is exactly wrong for a dash, where **the blow IS the body
  arriving at speed**. `finishAt` .38 × `from` .55 puts the window at u 0.21, and on a .30 s dash
  that is 0.063 s — by which point he has travelled about four metres. Measured through the real
  pad, a full hold at a warrior:
      3 m ahead    fired 0, he is idle, hp untouched   <- passed clean through him
      6 m ahead    fired 1, down, 15.0 m/s out
      12 m ahead   fired 1, down, 15.0 m/s out
  **So the ones close enough to matter were never hit at all**, which is most of *"they don't
  really"*. A dash opens at once (`dashFrom` 0) and the other strikes keep their wind-up.
  **AND `flatFar` CAME BACK DOWN, 24 -> 11.** Worth saying plainly: **24 had never once been
  SEEN.** m43 was the build that made `flatFar` mean anything at all — before it a man in front
  set the distance and these numbers were decoration — so the first time the hold actually drove
  the travel was also the first time anyone looked at what 24 m does. It is too far.
  **AND THE LAUNCH IS COMPARABLE TO THE DASH NOW, WHICH IS WHAT "FLYING" MEANS.** 15 m/s out is
  a perfectly good knock-down beside a man standing still and reads as nothing beside a man who
  has just covered 24 m: **the launch is judged against YOUR speed, not against zero.** 24 m/s
  and 8.5 up on the warrior, 26 / 9.0 on the hick, 25 / 8.8 on the hobo, with the drag eased so
  the flight is long enough to watch. These are the FULL-power numbers and everything under
  `fling` is graded up to them, so the ordinary jab is untouched.
- **THREE BUILDS OF TUNING COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE SHOWN, BECAUSE THE DISTANCE WAS NEVER THE
  HOLD'S TO SET (m43, `MELEE.dashFree`).** *"The charge melee STILL isn't really going very far.
  I have a feeling you've been implementing something and it's somehow not working, because
  nothing has changed and I've told you three times."* He was right three times, and every number
  I moved was real and irrelevant:
      const far = p.melTgt ? Math.min(gap, wantD) : wantD;
  `gap` is the distance to whoever `meleeLock` found in front of him. m21 solved the launch to
  land ON that man, on the argument that a leap which overshoots goes THROUGH people — correct
  for a LEAP, and it means the nearest body decides the travel and **the charge does not**.
  m37 flattened it to a dash, m40 raised `flatFar` to 24, m42 left it alone; none of them could
  reach a number that `min` was discarding. Measured through the real pad:
      nobody in front           24.00 m
      one man six metres ahead   4.95 m
      three of them about        2.95 m
  And the street has eighteen bodies in it now, so **the second row is what he was playing every
  single time**. `MELEE.aimCone` is 24 degrees and `finishRange` 26 m, so somebody is nearly
  always in it.
  **THE LOCK KEEPS THE FACING AND LOSES THE DISTANCE.** Aiming him at the man is the half that
  helps; clamping the travel to the gap is the half that ate the feature. And going through him
  stopped being a bug at m36: `hitAll` means a mace does not stop at the first man, so the swept
  weapon catches everyone the dash passes and the launch sends them. The hop and the arc keep
  m21, because those genuinely would sail over him. `mel.MELEE.dashFree = 0` restores it exactly.
- **AND NO HARNESS HAD EVER REACHED THE HAMMER'S OWN GATE (m43, `PADS` exported).** The charge
  arms on `holding = R.down && PADS.R.hold() > MOVE.tapT`, and `hold()` returns **0 unless a real
  pointer is down** — so every case that set `stick.R` directly and called `stepKit` was
  measuring a game in which the hammer charge CANNOT ARM. Case 13 sidestepped it by calling
  `chargeRelease()`, **which is the one thing a player never does**, and in doing so it skipped
  the target acquisition, the wind-up and the release edge in one go.
  **THIS IS THE REPO'S OLDEST MISTAKE AND THE TENTH TIME**, and it is the expensive shape of it:
  not a harness that measures the wrong rule, but one that enters a function past the branch the
  bug lives in. **The case that found it drives the pad**: it stubs `PADS.R.hold` to a rising
  clock, holds the pad up for 1.4 s, releases, and reads `p.goGap` — with bodies in the world,
  because an empty street is not the thing he is playing.
  **WHEN HE SAYS NOTHING CHANGED AND THE MEASUREMENT SAYS IT DID, THE HARNESS IS ENTERING
  SOMEWHERE HE CANNOT.** That is the thing to check first, before the numbers.
- **THE DASH NEEDED ITS OWN SPEED CAP, BECAUSE `maxV` IS ALSO AN ACQUIRE RADIUS (m40, `dashV`).**
  *"The charge on the weapon still is not far enough. He needs to LAUNCH forward -- launch, launch.
  I want it to be a very exaggerated forward, fast motion."* Four times in one breath, so both ends
  moved: `flatNear` 3.2 -> 5.5, `flatFar` 12.2 -> **24**, `dashDur` .38 -> .30, and the launch
  speed off `dashV` **66 m/s**. Measured through the shipped `chargeRelease`: **23.47 m covered
  for a 24.00 m solve**, on the floor the whole way, and a full charge flings a warrior at 15 m/s.
  **AND IT COULD NOT SIMPLY RAISE `maxV`**, which is the obvious move and is wrong twice over:
  that number is the ceiling on an ORDINARY lunge, and it is also `reachMax` -- the radius
  `meleeGo` is allowed to ACQUIRE a target inside. At 66 every jab would lock onto a man twenty
  metres off and rocket at him. **A number meant for one thing must not be shared with another**,
  which is `chargeGoH`'s own lesson at m27, one constant over.
  **`finishReach` AND `finishRange` HAD TO MOVE WITH IT.** `finishReach` caps the GAP a LOCKED
  dash is solved for, so left at 11 a man twenty metres away would be acquired and then arrived at
  less than half way -- a lock the move cannot deliver, which is the m20 complaint exactly.
- **AND A COLLIDER SAMPLED AT A POINT ONLY KNOWS WHERE IT WAS ASKED (m40, `MOVE.sub`).** At 66 m/s
  a 60 Hz frame is over a metre and a 30 Hz one is two, which is wide enough to pass clean through
  a box -- so `integrate` splits its step by **DISTANCE, never by time**. That is what makes a slow
  phone play the same game as a fast one, and at walking pace it is one step and costs nothing.
  Rollergirl paid for this one already: at 60 Hz sub-stepping contributes almost nothing and at
  20 Hz it is the whole difference, so **a collider test at 60 Hz is a flattering test.**
- **HOW BIG AN IMPACT IS AND WHAT IT IS MADE OF ARE TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS (m40, `WEAP.hitK`).**
  *"The particles on the plasma cannon are cool, I like them -- but the overall size, at least
  half. Not the particle size themselves, the full effect is just so big."* Exactly the right
  distinction and it is why this is not a smaller `size`: a spark's own size is how CHUNKY the
  debris reads, and the spread, the throw radius and the flash's three radii are how much SCREEN
  the event covers. `hitK` (.45) scales only the second kind, so the particles he likes are
  byte-for-byte the particles he had.
  **THE FLASH'S GROWTH IS A FOOTPRINT TERM TOO**, and it was the biggest one: `1 + u * 1.9` ends
  at 2.9x its own base, so most of what is on screen at the end of a flash is the growth and not
  the radius it started from. 1.15. **Scaling only the radii would have halved the beginning of
  the effect and left the end where it was.**
  **AND THE CLINGING SWARM IS LEFT ALONE**, because it is already sized off the BODY's own height
  and radius -- shrinking it would take it off the man it is clinging to, which is the one thing it
  exists to do. Only its rise goes through `hitK`.
- **A RANDOMLY RED ROW IS WORSE THAN A PERMANENTLY RED ONE, AND `npm run sim` HAD ONE (m40).**
  `foeRoll` gives every body its pace, nerve, react and guard out of `Math.random` -- right in the
  game, and it made the suite report a different answer every run: two rows failed one run and one
  the next, **on code that had not changed**. A result you cannot reproduce is not a measurement.
  One fixed stream now, so a red row is a fact about the code and can be chased; the variety cases
  still roll MANY bodies out of that stream, so what they measure is the spread across a roster
  rather than one lucky draw.
  **AND SEEDING IT IMMEDIATELY EXPOSED TWO INVENTED PASS MARKS IN THE SAME CASE.** "He closes to
  his reach" read the gap on ONE arbitrary frame, and at that frame he may be mid-BACK-OFF (3.5 m
  out, by design) or the run may simply have ended before he arrived; "he faces you" read the same
  frame, where he may be mid-CIRCLE and pointed along his circle, also by design. **A state machine
  is not measured on one frame** -- both are minima over the last stretch now, and the window is
  long enough that a wary `pace` is not what decides whether the suite is green. How slowly he
  closes is a stated open item, not what that case is about.
- **ONE DRAW CALL FOR EVERY PARTICLE IN THE GAME (m39, `SPK`, `spk`, `spkBurst`, `spkCling`).**
  *"It's so primitive -- when you shoot it just looks like a flash, and when it hits them
  there's barely anything. I want it to feel like it really hits them."* A sprite carries its
  own material, so sixty of them is sixty draw calls on the one part of a mobile GPU that is
  actually scarce. It is a POOL and a `Points` with per-point size, colour and alpha in
  attributes: one call for the lot, and a burst allocates nothing -- which matters, because the
  burst happens on the frame something is already being hit.
  **`gl_PointSize` IS DERIVED, NOT TUNED.** Half the framebuffer height over the tangent of half
  the vertical lens, so `aSize` is a size in WORLD METRES at any distance. A tuned constant
  changes size whenever the fov does, and this game's fov moves.
  **AND A SPARK CAN FOLLOW A BODY.** *"Maybe some little particles that go around their mesh."*
  A burst thrown in world space at a man who is being knocked backwards is left behind by him; a
  spark that carries his root and orbits it stays ON him. That is the whole difference between
  "particles happened near him" and "something is happening TO him", and it is why `follow` is a
  field on a spark rather than a second system.
  **THE FADE IS SQUARED.** A spark that dims evenly reads as fog; bright-then-gone reads as a
  spark.
- **AND HIS OWN MESH FLASHES, WHICH MEANT GIVING HIM HIS OWN MATERIALS (m39, `bodyFlash`).**
  *"Maybe their mesh kind of flashes."* The cheapest thing on screen that says a blow landed on
  HIM. **`skeletonClone` SHARES materials across every copy of a kind** -- flashing one warrior
  would have flashed all three -- so `bodySpawn` clones them per body. That is a second uniform
  set and the SAME shader, so nothing recompiles and the draw calls are unchanged; it is only
  ever worth saying no to if the count gets large.
- **AN IMPACT IS THREE THINGS, AND EACH DOES A DIFFERENT JOB (m39, `boltHit`).** A hot core
  flash that GROWS as it fades (a flash that only fades reads as a light being turned down; one
  that expands reads as something arriving), a radial burst of debris, and the clinging swarm
  plus the body flash above. All three scale off the same `chg` the ball's size and the blast
  radius come from, so a fumble is a spit and a full charge is an event.
  **AND THE BALL LEAVES A STREAK**, from the same pool: sparks dropped along its path with no
  velocity and a very short life, so it reads as a line of cooling plasma rather than a blob
  sliding across the screen.
- **THE MARK IS BACK WITHOUT THE LOCK, AT HALF THE SIZE (m39).** *"The aimer is gone for the
  blaster. I still want the aimer to be there -- it's just not the lock-on mode. Let's make it
  half the size it was."* Which is the right reading of m36: **what was annoying was the aim
  being TAKEN, not the mark being DRAWN.** `LOCK.retic` and `LOCK.on` were separated for exactly
  this. 210 -> 146 -> 74 -> **37 px**.
- **THE GUARD IS A STRAFE STANCE, AND IT BORROWS THE COMMITTED BRANCH (m39).** *"If he's
  disarmed and you hold down on the right stick he goes into strafe mode left and right --
  that's his guard. Same with the melee, honestly same with the blaster."* A stance faces
  forward and moves sideways, which is **exactly what `aiming` already does**: face where the
  lens is pointed and let `plant` go to zero so the legs carry him where the thumb says instead
  of dragging his body round. So it joins that branch rather than growing a second one, and
  `rigAnim`'s directional blend picks the strafe clip off the sign of his travel with nothing
  new written.
  **WITH NO BLOCK CLIP DRAWN, THERE IS NO UPPER POSE AT ALL** -- so `bare` plays the WHOLE
  strafe clips rather than their `__legs` halves, because a rifle pose on an unarmed man is
  worse than no pose. Name `CLIPS.block` and it becomes an override like every other.
  **AND IT CLEARS THE TRIGGER AND THE WIND-UP AS IT ARMS.** They are the same thumb pushed the
  other way and cannot both be true -- but a thumb sweeping from the top of the pad to the
  bottom would otherwise arrive still armed. `MOVE.blockSp` caps him: a guard shuffles.
- **`npm run sim`'s `run()` NEVER CALLED `stepKit` (m39).** Every case that held the RIGHT PAD
  was measuring a game with no weapon logic in it -- the guard simply never armed, on any slot,
  and the harness reported that as the feature being broken. **A harness that skips a step the
  game takes is measuring a different game**, which is this repo's oldest mistake and the ninth
  time it has been made.
  **And the guard case's own first pass mark was inverted** -- it compared a wrapped angle delta
  against pi and failed a correct answer of exactly zero. **Derive the pass mark from the rule**:
  what "strafe" MEANS is that the body does not follow the legs, so the delta must be SMALL.
- **A BODY THAT DOES NOT FIGHT IS ONE BRANCH, NOT A SECOND BRAIN (m38, `HICK`, `pacifist`,
  `foeWander`).** *"He's basically just an NPC, so he doesn't have attacks. He doesn't attack
  you -- if anything he'll run away. You shoot him, he flies through the air, lands on the
  ground, gets up and runs away."* A third kind in the same `DUMMIES` list: the bolt, the swept
  limb, `bodyFly`, `bodySep` and the player's resolver all reach him with nothing new written,
  and `foeAI` gains one line above everything that decides how to FIGHT. **`d.K` is what makes a
  third kind cost a table**, which is what m35 was for.
  **HE AMBLES ROUND WHERE HE WAS PUT**, not along a path and not at random: the ring is centred
  on his spawn, so a street left alone for ten minutes still looks like a street rather than
  four random walks that have drifted apart.
  **AND BEING HIT IS WHAT MAKES HIM LEAVE**, not proximity -- `flee0` seconds of running
  directly away, `fleeAdd` for each further blow, capped, so standing over him and punching is
  not a man who runs for a minute.
- **AN EMPTY CLIP NAME IS A HOOK, AND THE STATE STILL RUNS (m38).** *"I don't have the falling
  over or on-the-ground or getting-up animations yet, but I'll put them in."* So `downF`,
  `downB`, `upF` and `upB` are `''` in his table. `skinPlay` returns without doing anything and
  `skinWeights` takes its fallback to the idle, so **he still flies, still lands, still gets up,
  still runs away** -- and naming the clip later is one string with no branch to add. **The
  state machine and the animation are separate things, and this is what that separation buys.**
  **AND THE TABLE CHECK HAD TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE.** `bodySpawn` reports any name that is not
  in the file, which is the T-pose guard -- an empty name is a DELIBERATE gap and reporting it
  is the chip crying wolf. `n && !d.actions[n]`.
- **THE IN-AIR POSE IS A FIELD, NOT A BRANCH ABOUT WHO IS FLYING (m38, `K.clips.air`).** *"I need
  to add for every character an in-air pose so that you could send him flying."* A body more than
  a quarter of a metre off the ground holds `clips.air` and takes its fall clip back the moment
  it lands. The hick names `jump`; a kind that names nothing keeps the behaviour it had. **This
  is the field to fill in on the warrior and the officer when he draws theirs.**
- **AND THE HEALTH BAR IS THE KIND'S (m38).** It read `FOE.bar` in four places while being built
  for three kinds, so a smaller man would have worn the warrior's gauge at the warrior's height.
  A kind with no `bar` block simply has none.
- **THE REACTION WAS NEVER THE SAME CLIP -- IT WAS THE SAME SPEED (m37).** *"There should be
  multiple animations when I hit them. The problem is they always play the same one, it's really
  redundant -- I think I put three or four in there."* `npm run sim` settled it before anything
  was changed: **24 blows used all five clips, three to eight times each.** The PICK was never
  the problem. The clips run 1.0 to 1.8 s and `hitBeat` .62 played them at 1.6x to 2.9x, which
  turns a stagger, a gut shot and a head snap into the identical quick twitch. `hitBeat` 1.0 and
  `bigBeat` 1.5 let them play near their own length.
  **THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IN THIS FILE THAT "IT ALWAYS DOES THE SAME THING" MEANT "IT IS TOO
  FAST TO TELL APART".** A measurement that says the choice is varied does not say the RESULT is
  legible, and when a report and a measurement disagree the thing in between is usually the
  rate.
- **EVERY BLOW SHOVES HIM, AND THE INTEGRATOR MOVED OUT OF THE KNOCK-DOWN (m37, `bodyFly`).**
  *"Every melee should have kickback -- knock them back a little bit, same with the gun."*
  Nothing moved a body at all unless it went down, so a landed punch was a clip and a number and
  no contact whatever. The ballistic integration lived INSIDE the `down` branch, so adding a
  shove to the hit state would have meant a second integrator to keep in step with the first --
  it is `bodyFly` now, called for every body every frame, and a blow simply sets a velocity.
  **THE DRAG IS PER STATE**: in the air it is ballistic, on his feet it is scrubbing against the
  ground, which is a much shorter half-life. And the shove goes through `resolveBoxes`, or a
  punch puts a man inside a wall.
  **AND THE GUN GETS IT FOR FREE**, because a bolt has always landed through `dummyBlow`. One
  description of what a blow does, and the weapon only decides how hard.
- **THE CHARGED SWING IS A GROUND DASH NOW -- THE THIRD SHAPE THIS MOVE HAS HAD (m37,
  `MELEE.dash`).** *"When you're holding the melee weapon, that charge -- you don't jump in the
  air any more. It's a straight-ahead attack and the distance you go depends on how far you
  charge it."* m21 solved an arc from the gap, m36 flattened it to a hop, m37 takes the vertical
  out entirely. **Nothing is deleted**: `mel.MELEE.dash = 0` walks back to the hop and
  `flatHi = 3` from there to the arc, so three behaviours sit behind two switches.
  **THE DURATION STOPS FALLING OUT OF THE ARC AND HAS TO BE TYPED**, which is the one thing a
  solved arc gave for free -- and a state whose length disagrees with the clip it plays can only
  cut that clip off, so `dashDur` IS what the clip is compressed to.
  **AND IT IS SOLVED AGAINST `goDur`, NOT `T`.** On the ground `MELEE.carry` bleeds him from full
  speed to zero across the WHOLE state, and `goDur` carries `finishTail` on the end -- so solving
  against the travel time alone overshot by exactly the tail's share: **5.80 m for a 3.95 m
  solve**, caught by the sim on the first run. **A launch solved against a different clock than
  the one that spends it lands somewhere else.**
  **AND `flatFar` IS BOUNDED BY `maxV` OVER THAT CLOCK**, which is 10.3 m -- the same trap m36
  hit from the other side, where 14 m was silently clamped and a half hold landed where a full
  one did. `p.goGap` reports what it will actually cover.
- **`FOE.fling` CAME DOWN TO .70, BECAUSE A HAMMER COULD NEVER REACH .90 (m37).** *"If you charge
  it and hit them, they go flying, and the distance depends on how far you charged."* A finisher
  is `1.0 * chargeGoK`, which floors at `finishMin` .45 -- so at .90 only a near-full BOLT could
  ever launch anybody and the hammer had no range to be graded across. .70 puts the crossing at
  about a 60% charge on either weapon and leaves .70..1.0 for the launch itself. Measured: a full
  charge flings at 7.0 m/s, a half charge at 3.2.
- **DOWN ON THE RIGHT PAD IS A GUARD (m37, `BLOCK`, `WEAP.blockArc`).** *"I want to make it so
  that down on the right stick is block. I know I don't have a block animation yet, but I'll put
  one in."* The same four gates as the trigger, mirrored -- the pad already knows how to tell a
  deliberate push from a drag, and re-deriving that would be a second answer to one question.
  **THE ARC IS TIGHTER THAN THE TRIGGER'S** (.70 against 1.05), because a downward drag is a real
  camera gesture: anything with sideways travel in it is still the camera. Straight up barely
  orbits because its X is near zero, and the same is true straight down.
  **IT CANNOT BE HELD WHILE A STRIKE IS RUNNING**, which is what stops a guard cancelling the
  recovery -- the one thing this file says must not happen.
  **AND A BLOW FROM BEHIND IS NOT BLOCKED**, whatever the thumb is doing.
  **`CLIPS.block` IS EMPTY AND THAT IS THE HOOK.** Name it and `rigAnim` blends it at full weight;
  an empty name falls straight through to the gait with no branch to add, which is how
  `GAIT.sprint` and `HANG.clip` are written one repo over. Until then **the chip says `BLOCK`**,
  because a defensive state you cannot see is one nobody uses twice.
- **THE BOLT DOES NOT CURVE EITHER (m42, `WEAP.home.on = 0`).** *"I take back what I said about
  the ball from the blaster curving to hit targets. Let's silence that."* So the blaster now has
  **no assist of any kind**: m36 took the reticle's lock off on the argument that a mark which
  moves where you are POINTING takes the aim off your thumb, and the curving ball was the
  replacement — something you WATCH rather than something that moves your hands. It was a better
  idea than the thing it replaced and it is still not wanted. **The gun goes exactly where it is
  pointed, and that is the whole feature.**
  **NOTHING IS DELETED, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS A DECISION RATHER THAN A REWRITE.**
  `mel.WEAP.home.on = 1` brings the curve back with every number untouched and `mel.LOCK.on = 1`
  brings the other one back, so two rejected designs cost one character each to try again. Both
  were shipped, looked at on the phone and turned down — **which is the loop working**, not two
  wasted builds.
  **AND THE RETICLE IS UNAFFECTED**, because since m39 it only ever drew where the shot was
  already going. That is why it survived m36 and survives this: it is a POINTER, not a promise,
  and `aimTarget` is still the one answer both it and `fireBolt` read.
  **THE MELEE LUNGE IS STILL NOT THIS AND STILL STAYS.** `meleeLock` solves the launch for the
  gap so a swing thrown at a man ARRIVES — a physical assist with nothing drawn and nothing taken
  off the thumb. He has now asked to keep that half twice while turning down both of the others.
- **THE ASSIST MOVED FROM THE AIM TO THE BOLT (m36, `WEAP.home`, `LOCK.on = 0`).** *"We're
  gonna get rid of the aim assist on the blaster... instead if you shoot in the general
  direction of a player the ball ever so slightly curves to hit them. The reticle aimer thing is
  really annoying to use."* A better idea than the thing it replaces, and the reason is worth
  writing down: **a mark that moves where you are POINTING takes the aim off your thumb, so you
  stop aiming; a ball that curves is something you WATCH**, and it can only ever finish a shot
  you had already very nearly made.
  **IT IS A TURN RATE, NOT A SEEK.** `rate` radians a second is the whole of "ever so slightly"
  -- a bolt doing 44 m/s turning at 2.1 rad/s has a 21 m radius, so it closes a few degrees over
  its flight and cannot fetch a shot thrown at the sky. And it LEADS him off `d.wvx/wvz`, the
  body's own measured world velocity, because a walking man is not where he was when the ball
  left. `stepDummies` measures that rather than any state machine being asked.
  **THE LOCK TOOK THREE THINGS WITH IT** -- the mark, the camera coming round, and the left
  stick's orbit mode -- because two of them exist only to serve the mark. Nothing is deleted:
  `mel.LOCK.on = 1` restores the whole loop and `mel.LOCK.retic = 1` draws the mark without it.
  **THE MELEE LUNGE IS NOT THIS AND STAYS.** *"Take the lock off the melee charge -- it's just
  physically going to assist you."* `meleeLock` solves the launch for the gap so a swing thrown
  at a man ARRIVES. That is a physical assist with nothing drawn and nothing taken off the
  thumb, which is the half he asked to keep.
- **THE BALL IS THE CHARGE, IN ALL FOUR PLACES AT ONCE (m36).** *"Make the blast a little
  bigger, and the size should depend on how long you charge it -- a full charge should be a
  fairly hefty ball and the effect greater, it'll actually send them flying."* `chg` drives the
  picture (`ball0/ball1`), what it collides with, how wide the blast catches (`blast0/blast1`),
  and the power -- one number, so they cannot drift.
  **AND `dummyHit` NEVER DID BREAK ON THE FIRST BODY.** *"If I shoot a ball and it hits in the
  general area of a few of them, that should hit more than one."* It always looped them all; the
  RADIUS was `boltR + .45`, which is one man wide. A full charge now reaches over two and a half
  metres and a crowd goes over together. **Suspect the number before the loop.**
  **`FOE.fling` IS HOW `hard`'s UNREACHABILITY GOT ANSWERED.** m35 set `hard: 1.01` so DAMAGE is
  what puts a warrior down -- right for a fist, wrong for the biggest shot in the game. A blow
  at or over `fling` launches him whatever his health says, and the launch is graded above
  whichever threshold actually tripped.
- **AND THE MELEE SWEEP DID BREAK ON THE FIRST (m36).** *"There were three of them piled up and
  I was meleeing, but it would only ever hit one at a time."* Exactly that -- a `break`, which is
  the right shape for a bullet and the wrong one for a swing. **A mace does not stop at the first
  man.** `MELEE.hitAll`.
- **THE CHARGED SWING IS FLAT NOW, AND THE HOLD DECIDES THE DISTANCE (m36).** *"Make it so that
  jump attack doesn't go high up in the air any more -- it's just a straightforward launch, and
  how far you go depends on how long you hold the charge."* So the apex stops coming from the
  GAP and becomes one low hop (`flatHi`), and the distance comes from `chargeGoH`, the hold's own
  curve. m21's finding stands and is simply no longer wanted.
  **AND THE CEILING IS THE HOP, NOT THE NUMBER.** A .55 m apex is 0.47 s of flight, so at
  `maxV` 21 the furthest it can carry is about 9.9 m -- `flatFar` 14 was clamped there and a half
  hold landed in the same place as a full one, which is the hold buying nothing all over again.
  Both ends sit inside what the hop can deliver, and `p.goGap` reports `vx * T` rather than what
  was asked for: **a number that ignores its own clamp lies on exactly the interesting frame.**
  A man in front still shortens it, because a leap solved to land ON him is what stops the charge
  going through people. `mel.MELEE.flatHi = 3` is the A/B back to the arc.
- **RAPID FIRE IS A MODE, NOT A MODEL (m36).** *"A version of the gun that's more like a machine
  gun -- I'll probably make a different model but we can use this for now. When you hold forward
  it just shoots automatically."* Same file, same mount, same four trigger gates: `auto` spends
  the hold as ROUNDS instead of banking it as a charge, and `p.chg` is pinned at `autoChg` so the
  ball, the blast, the power and the recoil all still come off the one number they always did.
  The release fires nothing, because everything was already fired. It is a separate SLOT rather
  than a toggle because the kit is already a tap-to-cycle list and **a hidden mode is a state you
  can be in without knowing it**. Its own GLB later is one `file:` in the roster.
- **THREE MEN RUNNING ONE SCRIPT IS NOT THREE MEN (m36, `FOE.vary`, `foeRoll`, `foePlan`).**
  *"They all slowly walk towards me in the exact same walk -- there's no variation, no speed
  variation, they don't try to block at all and they only ever do one swing. Very, very
  repetitive."* Every one of those is the same fault. Each body rolls his own `pace`, `nerve`,
  `react` and `guard` once at spawn, and **none of them change what he DOES** -- only how fast,
  how close, how eager and how soon -- so the state machine stays one thing to reason about.
  **AND HE CIRCLES, COMBOS AND GIVES GROUND.** `standing_walk_left/right` were in the file and
  unused; a man who only ever walks straight at you is the whole complaint. `foePlan` is one
  place deciding between a guard, a circle, giving ground and a swing, so the mix reads as a
  sentence rather than being reconstructed from four scattered branches.
  **HE ALSO SWUNG FROM OUTSIDE HIS OWN REACH, WHICH IS WHY IT LOOKED LIKE ONE ANIMATION ON A
  LOOP.** The walk stopped at `hold` 3.4 m and the mace reaches 2.4 + your .34 = 2.74, so every
  swing at a player standing still was thrown at air a foot in front of him.
  **AND `nerve` COULD PUT HIM SOMEWHERE HE COULD NEVER ATTACK FROM.** At 1.25 `hold` became
  3.25 m against a `hitR` of 2.6, so a wary one who had closed once stood there, failed
  `foePlan`'s range test for ever and **never swung again**. `npm run sim` caught it as **0
  swings in 40 s on about one roll in four** -- which is exactly the shape of a bug that reads as
  "sometimes one of them just stands there" and would never have been found by reading. Both
  distances are clamped inside `hitR` now: **a distance he cannot attack from is not a distance
  to stand at.**
  **AND THEY DO NOT STAND INSIDE EACH OTHER (`bodySep`).** `pushBodies` was only reached from the
  walking branch, so the moment two of them stopped -- which is exactly when they are both
  standing on you -- nothing kept them apart. It runs for every body every frame now, and it is
  SYMMETRIC: each pushes out by half, so neither shoves the other across the street.
  **A HARNESS CASE THAT COUNTS ONE THING CANNOT SEE "REPETITIVE".** `npm run sim` counts distinct
  swing CLIPS and distinct STATES over a forty-second fight, because "he swings twice" passes
  happily on a man doing the identical thing twice.
- **THE STRIKE CLIPS ARE THE REAL PROBLEM AND THEY ARE BEING REDRAWN (m36).** *"The animations
  look really bad -- they're really fast and you can't even tell what he's doing. I'll probably
  just put in strike poses, so it'll be like a dash ending in a strike pose, close to those 2D
  side-scroller fighting games based on old arcade games where the poses are really
  exaggerated."* `MELEE.beat` went .44/.50/.62 -> .62/.68/.82, which is the most that can be done
  from this side: a 1.0-1.75 s clip at 3x is a blur with no pose in it, and at 2x it is a blur
  slightly longer. **A dash-and-hold pose is a different SHAPE of move, not a slower clip** --
  the travel would come first and the pose would be held at the end, which is `MELEE.carry`
  inverted. Wire it when the clips land; do not try to fake it by retuning `carry`.
- **A NEW ENEMY IS A TABLE AND A BRAIN, NOT A SECOND EVERYTHING (m35, `FOE`, `d.K`, `foeAI`).**
  *"Make him walk around, make it so I can shoot him, make him fight back."* The warrior goes
  into the SAME `DUMMIES` list the officer is in, because the bolt, the swept limb, the aim
  lock and the player's own resolver already reach everything in that list. Every body carries
  `d.K` -- its kind -- and `dummyBlow` and `stepDummies` read that instead of a global, so the
  officer is untouched and there is no second damage path, no second collider path and no
  second thing to keep in step. `bodyProto`/`bodySpawn` are shared; two builders used to hold
  twenty lines of the scale measurement by copy, which is two places for it to drift.
  **`bodyLoops` DERIVES WHICH CLIPS LOOP FROM THE TABLE** rather than listing them twice, so
  adding a swing cannot accidentally make it repeat.
  **THE BLOW LANDS PART-WAY THROUGH HIS SWING, NOT ON THE FRAME HE DECIDED TO SWING.** That is
  m20's rule pointed the other way: a swing and its consequence arriving as two events is what
  "you can't actually hit things" looks like, and it is just as true when the thing being hit
  is you. `swingAt` is where in the beat the mace arrives.
  **AND IT IS A CONE, NOT A CIRCLE** -- `dummyHit`'s own m20 fault, which was a range check with
  no direction test at all, so a punch thrown forwards hit a man standing behind. Pinned: a
  swing thrown the wrong way costs you nothing.
  **A GUARD IS WORTH SOMETHING OR IT IS AN ANIMATION.** Blocking does not stop a blow, it takes
  `blockCut` out of it -- and it plays its own react clip, so "he blocked that" and "he ate
  that" are two different pictures rather than a number nobody can see.
  **DAMAGE IS PER WEAPON (`FOE.dmg`).** *"Different weapons will do different effects to him."*
  A fist is the cheapest, the hammer costs more, the charged finisher most, and a bolt carries
  its own. **The officer has no `dmg` table and spends one hit point per blow exactly as he
  always has** -- a kind without the field keeps the old rule rather than inheriting a new one.
  **AND `hard` IS UNREACHABLE ON HIM ON PURPOSE.** For the officer a full-power blow is an
  instant knock-down; for the warrior DAMAGE is what puts him down, which is the entire point of
  having six hit points and a bar. Setting `hard: 1.01` says that in the table rather than in a
  branch.
  **A HEALTH BAR IS WHAT MAKES "A FEW HITS" LEGIBLE.** Without one a man who has taken five
  blows and a man who is ignoring you are the same picture. It faces the camera, it is HIDDEN
  while he is untouched and not hunting (an idle street is not a row of floating gauges), and it
  grows from the LEFT edge -- a bar scaled about its middle at 50% reads as a different bar
  rather than as half of this one.
  **EVERY STATE ENDS ON ITS OWN CLOCK.** An enemy you can wedge into a state he cannot leave is
  worse than one who gives up too early, and `lose > notice` so the edge of his attention cannot
  flicker.
  **AND HE WALKS ON THE PLAYER'S OWN RESOLVER**, plus `pushBodies` against the other bodies with
  himself skipped -- one description of a body taking up room, not two.
  **THE PLAYER HAS HEALTH NOW, AND NO DEATH.** *"Make him fight back"* has no consequence
  without it. There is no hit-reaction clip in the antenna alien's export, so a blow IS a
  knockback, a moment of no steering (`MOVE`'s own `wantSp = 0`) and a flash at the edge of the
  screen -- and the stun is short on purpose, because being unable to move is the least fun
  state in any game and the knockback is doing most of the work. **A dodge roll is still the one
  thing that saves you**, which is what `p.roll`'s i-frames were always for.
  **`npm run sim` DRIVES THE BRAIN, AND HIS BODY IS FABRICATED -- A STATED GAP.** The warrior GLB
  is draco and no harness here can build a skin, so what is under test is what the brain reads:
  `root.position`, `st`, `hp` and a clip table. The clip NAMES and DURATIONS come straight out of
  the file, so the beats and the scaling are the real arithmetic, and one case asserts every name
  in `FOE.clips` is in the file -- a name that is not there leaves a bone at zero total weight,
  which is the T-pose exactly. The mount, the bar and the poses are device questions.
- **AND `npm run sim`'s CHARGED-SWING CASE HAD BEEN MEASURING A RULE THE GAME NO LONGER HAD
  (m35).** It asserted the release drives him forward at over 9 m/s -- true of the fixed leap
  **m21 deliberately replaced**, whose whole point is that a constant launch can only do one
  distance. With nobody in front of him the correct answer is nearly straight up, so the case
  failed for builds while the code was right, and a suite with a permanent red row is a suite
  nobody reads. It measures the arc now: free he goes UP and reaches the apex he solved for, a
  man seven metres off turns it into a leap that LANDS ON HIM, and a half charge jumps lower.
  **Its replacement's own first pass mark was invented too** (`melV > vFree + 3`, failing a
  correct 5.26) -- **derive the pass mark from the rule, never from a number that looked right**,
  which is now the third time in this file.
- **A BOUNDING BOX IS NOT A BUILDING (m26, `solidColumns`).** *"I'm just running into invisible
  walls."* Right, and it is structural: a single AABB is solid everywhere the SHAPE is not -- a
  doorway, a setback, a tapered wall, the air over a canopy. So the collider is rasterised out
  of the mesh's own triangles: the footprint is gridded, each cell learns the lowest and highest
  triangle over it, and runs of AGREEING cells merge into boxes. Where there is no geometry
  there is no box, which is the whole fix.
  **Two things are load-bearing and Shredworld paid for both:**
    1. **A TRIANGLE'S BOUNDING BOX IS NOT ITS SHAPE.** A sloped quad running from the foot of a
       wall to the top of a canopy has a box covering the whole span, so taking the height from
       the BOX tells every cell under the canopy that the wall reaches the ground. The box picks
       the CELLS; the height over each comes from the triangle's PLANE, clamped back inside that
       triangle's own y range. A vertical face has no useful plane in y and keeps its full span.
    2. **A CELL MUST AGREE WITH THE RUN IT JOINS, not merely fail to enlarge it.** Asking whether
       a cell GROWS the run lets a short canopy cell (3.5..6.2) be swallowed by a full-height
       wall run (0..6.2) -- it grows it by nothing -- and the whole canopy then comes out as one
       box reaching the ground. The test is on BOTH ends.
  **A mesh whose columns nearly all span its full height IS its bounding box** (`BLD.full`) and
  collapses back to one, which is most plain blocks and costs nothing. **The cell GROWS to fit
  `maxCells`** rather than the mesh being skipped. `BLD.cols = 0` is the old single box.
  **And `mel.bld(h)` RE-RASTERISES**, because the columns are WORLD boxes and cannot be scaled
  in place -- leaving the old ones is a building you walk into at its previous size.
- **A MAN IS A SOLID, AND HE WAS NOT IN THE COLLIDER AT ALL (m26, `pushBodies`).** *"Can we put
  collide on the police officers, because right now I can just run through them."* `BOXES` is
  built once at load, so nothing that WALKS can ever be in it. His body is handed to the
  player's own resolver every frame instead, the way a car's is in Shredworld: one physics path,
  not two to keep in step.
  **A CIRCLE, NOT A BOX.** A man is round; an axis-aligned box the width of his shoulders reads
  wrong at the corners, and an oriented one would swing as he turns and have to be tested in its
  own frame for nothing gained.
  **AND WHO IS SOLID IS A STATE, NOT A SWITCH.** Standing or staggering he stops you, which is
  the weight a fight needs. DOWN or GETTING UP he does not -- stepping over a man on the floor
  is right and being shoved off him is not. And nobody is solid during the charged LEAP, whose
  whole arc was solved to land ON him: bouncing off would undo m21.
- **A SOUND CUT MID-WAVEFORM IS A CLICK (m26, `snd`'s `dur`).** *"There's a residual electric
  noise when you shoot somebody and it just keeps playing for the full gambit of the noise."*
  `SFX.edge` trims the SILENCE off a recording and has nothing to say about a file that is
  simply longer than the event it stands for -- `electricity_beam_01.mp3` is a BEAM, seconds of
  it, and arming the trigger is an instant. `dur` caps it, with a linear ramp over the last
  fraction, because stopping a buffer mid-waveform is a step discontinuity.
- **THE BUILDING HAD NO COLLIDER AT ALL, AND THE CHIP BLAMED THE NETWORK (m32).** *"I'm still
  just like walking through this building."* The chip in his shot read **`NO BUILDING GLB`** with
  the building plainly standing in the scene -- which is the whole diagnosis, because those two
  cannot both be true of a load that failed. It was a **temporal dead zone** in the placement
  loop: `const b0 = { o, bx, ... }` read `bx` two lines above its own `const`, so every
  placement threw a ReferenceError **after `world.add(o)` had already run**. The mesh renders,
  not one box ever reaches `BOXES`, and the throw unwound into `init()`'s catch, which reported
  it as a missing file. Shipped since m24.
  **AND THE CATCH SWALLOWED THE EXCEPTION**, which is why it cost several builds: `catch { note('NO
  BUILDING GLB') }` cannot tell "the file is not there" from "the builder threw", and those want
  completely different fixes. `side()` splits them -- a rejected fetch says `NO X GLB`, a throw
  inside the builder says `X FAILED` **and `console.error`s the real error**. A diagnostic that
  names the wrong half is worse than none: it sent me looking at `bump.mjs`'s hashes and at the
  wire.
  **NEITHER GATE CAN SEE THIS.** `check:syntax` only parses, and `check:boot` never enters
  `buildBuildings` because headless every `loadGLB` rejects -- so the one class of fault the boot
  gate exists for walked straight past it one function further in. That is the standing shape of
  a TDZ here and it is the seventh time across these repos.
- **A PICTURE AND THE THING YOU WALK INTO ARE ONE OBJECT (m24).** A building pushes its
  footprint into `BOXES` -- the same list the collider, the floor test and the camera boom all
  read -- so there is one description of the world rather than two to keep in step. `mel.bld(h)`
  re-sizes the mesh AND rewrites its box, because two things re-sized separately is a building
  you can stand inside, which is the worst kind of bug: nothing on screen disagrees with
  anything and the player simply cannot walk there.
  **Placements are yawed in QUARTER TURNS ONLY.** `resolveBoxes` here is axis-aligned, and the
  AABB of a box rotated 45 degrees is forty per cent too big along BOTH axes -- the phantom hit,
  where the collider touches you and the mesh plainly does not. An arbitrary yaw needs an
  oriented box tested in its own frame (Shredworld has one; this does not, yet).

- **SECONDARY MOTION: THE CHAINS ARE FOUND, NOT NAMED (m28, `CHAIN`, `findChains`).** A chain
  is an unbranched run of bones **that no clip meaningfully moves** — measured across every clip
  in the file. On her that separates cleanly: her body reads 8.5 to 86 degrees and every hair
  and tail bone reads **0.03**, because the export keys them at their rest value and nothing
  else. `minBones` 6 excludes the one false positive, a 3-bone thumb that happens to be inert in
  these three clips. A NAME test would have worked here and would break on the next export that
  spells it differently; **"no clip moves it" is a property of what the thing IS.**
  **AND THEIR TRACKS ARE STRIPPED — after the chains are found, because the finder needs them.**
  Keyed at rest, the mixer would write that rest pose onto every chain bone every frame and
  fight the solver for the same bones: two writers, which this file has paid for twice. It also
  takes 405 of her 579 channels out of the mixer.
  **THE REACTION TO HER MOTION IS FREE.** Particle 0 is PINNED to where the skeleton puts it and
  everything downstream arrives late, because that is what a spring does. There is no
  "react to movement" term anywhere in the solver — **the lag IS the effect.**
  **THE SPRING PULLS TOWARD THE POSE, AND THE POSE HAS TO BE RE-DERIVED.** Reading the bones'
  current world positions is springing toward the solver's OWN last output — a no-op dressed up
  as stiffness, because those bones are carrying what the solver wrote last frame rather than
  the authored rest. The home chain is walked forward from the pin using the parent's world
  rotation and each bone's HOME local, which is what it would look like with no dynamics.
  **`getWorldQuaternion`, NEVER `setFromRotationMatrix(matrixWorld)`** when converting a solved
  world direction back to a local rotation — m17's bug, and this is exactly where it would bite
  again.
  **A FIXED SUBSTEP** (`CHAIN.hz`), because Verlet under a varying dt is unstable and a 120 Hz
  phone would otherwise play different hair from a 30 Hz one — `exp(-k*dt)`'s argument, one
  system over.
  **A CONE LIMIT**, because Verlet has no notion of a joint limit and a segment that inverts
  reads as a broken bone rather than as hair.
  **AND SPHERE HULLS ON HEAD / CHEST / HIPS.** Without them the hair passes through her
  shoulders, which is the one thing that makes this read as broken rather than as hair.
  **The cost is nothing**: ~138 particles at 3 constraint passes is a few thousand flops against
  a mixer that already skins 11,000 vertices. It belongs to the ARTICULATE characters only —
  a crowd copy runs without it.
  **EVERY RATE IS PER SECOND, AND THE FIRST VERSION APPLIED THEM PER SUBSTEP (m29).** *"The tail
  is kind of glitchy, not really moving much. The hair moved a tiny bit... but when she got up
  on the cube it jiggled really nicely."* One arithmetic error described precisely: at `drag`
  .06 a substep and 90 substeps a second the velocity retained **0.94^90 = 0.4% per second** --
  dead inside a tenth of a second -- and `stiff` .16 a substep glued every particle to the pose
  in **69 ms**. Small motions were erased entirely and only a big impulse could show at all.
  Converted with `exp(-k*h)` per substep, which is **this file's own standing rule about never
  scrubbing a value with a bare per-frame factor** -- it had simply never been applied here.
  After: hair retains 25% of its velocity per second and settles toward the pose in 0.20 s at
  the root, 1.0 s at the tip.
  **AND THE CONE CLAMP DOUBLE-NEGATED ACROSS w = 0 (m29).** q and -q are the same rotation, so
  on the far side the stored AXIS is flipped too -- clamping to `-cone` about an already flipped
  axis negates twice and the joint SNAPS the wrong way. That is the "glitchy" half, and it is
  the same q/-q trap this file already has a note about one measurement over. Canonicalise all
  four components first; then the angle is always in [0, pi] and the clamp is unsigned.
  **AND IT WAS DERIVED AGAINST THE WRONG SPRING (m32).** *"Her hair is still wiggling, tail is
  still wiggling."* `2*sqrt(stiff)` treats `stiff` as a spring constant in 1/s^2, and it is a
  per-second RELAXATION RATE for a positional pull. **In Verlet a positional pull of fraction
  `a` per substep IS an acceleration of `a/h^2`**, so the natural frequency is `sqrt(a)/h`, and
  at 90 Hz that is 20.9 rad/s on a hair root rather than the 2.2 the formula assumed. Measured
  across the file: **zeta 0.12 to 0.14 on every particle** -- twelve per cent of critical, a
  spring that rings for eight cycles, which is the wiggle described precisely. m30 was the right
  idea (creamy IS critical damping, and the ratio IS the honest knob) applied to a frequency the
  solver does not have. `c*h` then cancels the h and the whole drag is `exp(-2*sqrt(a)*ratio)`.
  **THE TWO HALVES SHARE ONE EXPRESSION**, because `a` is literally the lerp fraction the spring
  applies on the same particle three lines later -- so retuning a stiffness moves the damping
  with it rather than leaving it describing a different spring, which is what typing them
  separately did once already.
  **A DAMPING RATIO IS A NUMBER YOU CAN CHECK.** Both times this was wrong the code looked
  reasonable and the only way to see it was to work out what zeta actually came to; 0.12 is not
  a judgement call about how hair should feel, it is a spring that must ring.
  **AND CRITICAL DAMPING CANNOT COVER A DISTANCE CONSTRAINT, WHICH IS WHAT WAS LEFT (m33).**
  *"Her hair is jingling around, and goes wild when she drops down the curb."* Two symptoms, one
  place: the constraint pass. `damping` is derived against the pull-to-pose rate and there is a
  SECOND restoring force in here with no rate at all -- the segment-length projection, which is
  an infinitely stiff spring. **In Verlet every metre a constraint moves a particle becomes a
  metre per step of velocity on the next one**, so the pose spring stopped overshooting at m32
  and the constraints went on feeding it. `CHAIN.snap` is how much of a correction is allowed to
  be banked as speed -- `prev` is moved with the particle by the rest. It is not damping and
  costs nothing when nothing is stretched; it is refusing to turn a position fix into energy.
  **AND THE DROP IS THE STANDARD WAY THIS SOLVER COMES APART.** Stepping off a kerb moves her
  head further in one substep than a hair segment is LONG, so the particle behind it is
  stretched past its own rest length, the constraint that pulls it back overshoots, and the
  overshoot is a bigger correction and therefore more velocity. `CHAIN.maxV` is the hard ceiling
  under it.
  **AND IT IS MEASURED RELATIVE TO THE PIN, WHICH IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF.** An absolute speed
  cap clamps every strand the moment she RUNS -- her whole body is doing 7 m/s and so is her
  hair -- which is exactly the motion these chains exist to show. The cap is on the part of the
  velocity that is not her own travel, so only hair moving fast through HER frame is held.
  `mel.CHAIN.snap = 1` and `mel.CHAIN.maxV = 99` are the A/B back to m32.
  **CREAMY IS CRITICAL DAMPING, AND IT IS DERIVED FROM THE STIFFNESS (m30).** *"Everything is
  kind of wiggling around a lot now -- can we add damping? I had a good amount of it and it was
  making it nice and smooth and creamy."* What creamy IS, is critical damping: a spring of rate
  k stops ringing at exactly `c = 2*sqrt(k)`, and anything under that overshoots, which is the
  wiggle. Typing the two separately means they drift apart the moment either is tuned, so
  `damping` is a RATIO -- 1.0 critical, over creamy, under springy -- and the drag falls out of
  whatever stiffness that particle actually has. The tip is softer than the root, so its damping
  is softer too, by construction and with no second number.
  **AND SIDEDNESS IS THE FILE'S TO DECIDE (m29).** Forcing `FrontSide` was right on the BUILDING
  -- a closed shell has no use for its inside -- and wrong on a CHARACTER: hair cards, a skirt
  and anything with an open edge are authored to be seen from both sides, and on a mesh whose
  winding is inverted it shows you the inside, which reads as *"seeing the back of the
  normals"*. The TRANSPARENCY fix stays, because BLEND genuinely does sort against itself.
  `SHE.side` is the dial and 'auto' honours the export.
  `mel.she.spin = 2` turns her on the spot, which is the best look at what the chains are doing;
  `mel.CHAIN.on = 0` freezes the solver so the authored pose can be compared against it.
